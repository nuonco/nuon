# Plugins

This package contains configs for plugins, as well as shared tooling for building plugins.

## Migration Path

When we originally set out, it was faster/easier to debug the plugin tooling by just rendering go templates. This was always a short term solution, and we will be migrating the existing plugin configs to this package.
