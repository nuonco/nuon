# Contributing to Nuon

Welcome, and thank you for your interest in contributing to Nuon!

There are several ways in which you can contribute. The goal of this document is
to provide an overview of how you can get involved.

## Asking Questions

Have a question? Instead of opening a GitHub issue, please ask in
[our Community Slack](https://nuon-byoc.slack.com) in particular the `03_help`
channel.

[Click this invite to join our Community Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/nuon-byoc/shared_invite/zt-3kzp3zpn4-0pHH4kGZ3OJul2p_y1Mzag)

The Nuon community will be quick to respond and your question will serve as a
resource to others searching for help.

## Providing Feedback

### GitHub Issues

[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/nuonco/nuon/issues) should be used for bugs
and feature requests.

We do not want to use GitHub issues for general feedback or questions so we may
redirect these questions to Slack.

### Slack

[Nuon's Community Slack](https://nuon-byoc.slack.com) workspace is the preferred
place to ask questions and provide feedback.

[Click this invite to join our Community Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/nuon-byoc/shared_invite/zt-3kzp3zpn4-0pHH4kGZ3OJul2p_y1Mzag)

Please ask techinical questions in the `03_help` channel. Look for announcements
in the `01_community-general` channel and you're welcome to introduce yourself
in the `02_welcomes-and-intros` channel.

## Reporting Issues

Have you identified a reproducible problem in Nuon? Do you have a feature
request? We want to know about it. Here's how you can report your issue as
effectively as possible.

### Look For an Existing Issue

Before you create a new issue, please do a search in
[open GitHub Issues](https://github.com/nuonco/nuon/issues) to see if the issue
or feature request has already been filed.

If you find your issue already exists, make relevant comments and use 👍 emoji
to upvote and 👎 to downvote.

If you cannot find an existing issue that describes your bug or feature, create
a new issue using the guidelines below.

### Writing Good Bug Reports and Feature Requests

File a single issue per problem and feature request. Do not add multiple bugs or
feature requests in the same issue.

Do not add your issue as a comment to an existing issue unless it's for the
identical input. Many issues look similar but have different causes.

The more information you can provide, the more likely someone will be successful
at reproducing the issue and finding a fix.

Please include the following with each issue:

- Version of Nuon control plane and Nuon CLI
- Your operating system (control plane and/or CLI)
- Reproducible steps (1... 2... 3...) that cause the issue
- What you expected to see, versus what you actually saw
- Images or a link to a video (e.g., Loom) showing the issue occurring
- A code snippet that demonstrates the issue or a link to a code repository

## Issue Management

We will close any issue marked `info-needed` or if we are waiting for a response
if there has been no response in 30 days. If the issue is still relevant, please
feel free to reopen it with any additional information.

### Creating Pull Requests and Contributing Fixes

Stay tuned for more information on how to contribute code and fixes to Nuon. In
the meantime, use GitHub Issues to outline your ideas and Nuon may open GitHub
Discussions for broader community input.

## Thank You

Your feedback, bug finding, and ideas to Nuon's open source will ensure a
stronger and feature-rich project. Thank you for taking the time to get
involved.
