# Demo Org

Terraform for managing our demo org using the `nuon` terraform provider.

## Local development

Eventually, once the provider is stable, we will manage this with terraform cloud. For now, when making changes to the provider and testing here the provider must be built/installed locally.

To install the provider locally, run:

```bash
$ nuonctl scripts exec install-terraform-provider
```
