# - explain what Nuon is and how we enable BYOC
# - walk through the desired end-state with an existing demo install, to explain what we'll be creating

# we now enter the terminal to demo the vendor experience of creating a BYOC app

    notes: |
      We're now going to switch roles, from the BYOC developer, to the BYOC customer.
      As a customer, I'm going to visit the developer's installer to install their app in my cloud account.
      To show how easy this is, let's use Cloudformation to create the IAM role.
      Now that I have the ARN, I simply paste into the installer and go.
      At this point, Nuon takes over. It will provision the install and deploy the app for me.
    cmd:
      - open
      - https://app.stage.nuon.co/installer/demo-byoc-eks-app

  - name: Monitor installs in the dashboard
    notes: |
      Back on the developer side of things, if I open the Nuon dashboard, I'll see the new install being created for Acme Inc.
      Clicking on the install in the list, the detail view shows my the sandbox being provisioned, the components the install has found, and the component deploys.
    cmd:
      - open
      - https://app.stage.nuon.co

  - name: Next steps
    notes: |
      Now you know how to create a BYOC app, and how easy it is for customers to install it.
      Next, you may want to take a look at our docs to learn how you can configure your own BYOC app to deploy with Nuon.
