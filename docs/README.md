🚀 Configure, install, and run your app in your customer's cloud in minutes with Nuon.
{% endhint %}

Nuon enables you to run any application in your customer's cloud. In just a few minutes, you can deploy your application and start running in every one of your customer's cloud accounts — offering them a faster, more secure solution.

Nuon works in three easy steps:

* **Configure** - connect the parts of your application such as containers, Helm charts, or Terraform modules. If Nuon does not support a part of your stack today, you can build a plugin to connect it, instead of having to refactor your application.
* **Install** - you can install your application in one customer's or a million customers' clouds. Each install is fully automated, self-managing and all your customer has to do is give you a one-time use IAM role.
* **Run** - Nuon runs a secure agent in each install that powers deployments, updates and operations. The agent gives you the tools you need to understand and remediate the health of your application.
