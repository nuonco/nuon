# 👋 Welcome to Nuon

{% hint style="info" %}
**🚀:**Connect your app to Nuon and run in your customer's cloud in minutes.
{% endhint %}

## Overview

Nuon enables you to run any application in your customers cloud. In just a few minutes, you can integrate your application and start running in every single one of your customer's cloud accounts -- offering a faster, more secure deployment for them.

Nuon works in three easy steps:

* **connect** - connect the parts of your application that you and your team are already using. Bring your own
  containers, helm charts, terraform modules or just a Dockerfile. If Nuon does not support a part of your stack today, you can build a plugin to connect it, instead of having to refactor your application.

* **install** - you can install your application in 1 customer, or a million customer's clouds. Each install is fully
  automated, self-managing and all your customer has to do is give you a one-time use IAM role.

* **run** - Nuon runs a secure agent in each install that powers deployments, updates and operations. The agent not only
  lets you deploy hundreds of times a day, but also gives you the tools you need to understand and remediate the health of your application.
