## Can I run Nuon in my own cloud account?

That's an option we've considered offfering. If it's important to you, reach out us.

## Do you support clouds other than AWS?

Not yet, but that's coming soon.

## What if my app doesn't run on EKS or AWS?

You can use the aws-ecs sandbox to run just about anything on AWS.

## What if none of your sandboxes support my app?

You can fork any of the sandboxes and modify them as needed, or even create your own from scratch!
