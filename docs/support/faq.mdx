Common questions about BYOC, working with Nuon, and what types of applications we support.

## Deployment Options

### Do you support running Nuon in my own account?

Yes, for enterprise contracts we can deploy Nuon into your own cloud account.

### Can I use my own IAM role for delegating access for customer installs?

Currently, all application installs must grant one time access to a Nuon owned IAM role on AWS. We are adding support to 
add your own role which all install access can be federated through.

Please watch our [roadmap](/updates/roadmap) for more details.

### Does my customer need to know about Nuon?

Nuon is completely white label, and you should not need to communicate to your users that Nuon is powering your BYOC 
install. 

### Does Nuon need to be added as a data subprocessor?

No, you should not need to add Nuon as a data subprocessor as no data is sent or stored on our servers beyond basic 
debugging and telemetry data.

## Support

### Do you support self-service?

Yes, but we currently encourage customers to go through a more white-glove onboarding experience. This allows us to 
gather product feedback and address any challenges in the onboarding process faster, and make sure we help you get into 
production.

### Do you do slack support?

Yes, we setup a shared slack channel with every customer to ensure we can deliver a consistent, fast support experience. 
We currently do not support customers outside of slack.

If you would like to use Nuon, but currently are not using slack please [let us know](mailto:team@nuon.co).

### Do you offer support plans?

Support is baked into each of our support plans, and we offer 7 day a week support in the EST -> PST timezones. For 
annual contracts, we can offer custom support SLAs.

### I have never gotten into production with a large enterprise customer, can you help?

Yes, our mission is to help you get into production, powering real customer workloads. We often help companies in three ways:

1. going through procurement, and preparing for any questions/feedback.
1. sharing templates for pricing, documentation and architecture.
1. joining customer calls, where applicable, to help any answer questions.

### How long should it take to get into production with my first customer?

We recommend about 1 month from sign up to production. We generally see the following timelines:

1. 1 to 2 days to get your application fully configured.
1. ~1 week of testing your application, pushing out updates and monitoring in different regions.
1. ~1 week to set up your installer, get it integrated in your product and setup Github Actions for automatic updates.
1. ~1 week for any customer specific requirements.

## Application Support

### I only have a Dockerfile, can you support my app?

Most of our customers have existing infrastructure as code, deployment and devops automation so our platform currently 
works best with some tooling experience there.

In early Q4, we will be launching a PAAS-like experience which will allow any company to easily convert applications 
from Render, Fly or Heroku to Nuon applications and offer BYOC deployments.

### Do I have to know Kubernetes?

No, Nuon supports any type of application that can be deployed on public clouds. From serverless, to container apps, to 
any other cloud resource.

In some cases, we will recommend supporting Kubernetes for large enterprise customers who may want to use their own 
sandbox or have kubernetes specifi requirements.

### Do you support serverless apps?

Yes, any application that uses public cloud primitives can be deployed via Nuon.

### Do you support GCP?

Not yet, but this is on our short term roadmap. Please watch our [roadmap](/updates/roadmap) for more details.

### Do you support AWS Gov Cloud regions?

Yes, you should be able to deploy a Nuon application into a Gov Cloud region, as long as the services you are using are 
supported.

### Do you support fed-ramp environments?

Yes, depending on your application stack you can use Nuon to deploy into Fed Ramp environments.

### Can I only use public cloud resources?

No, you can use vertical cloud products such as [CloudFlare](https://cloudflare.com), [Fastly](https://fastly.com) and 
many more to provision your applications. Simply declare an input to allow users to input credentials and use that to 
configure any IAC or other tooling in your Nuon app.

### Do you support bring your own key?

Yes, you can allow users to add their own encryption keys, api keys and other credentials using 
[inputs](/concepts/inputs).

## Updating my app

### Can I deploy to a single install?

Yes, you can deploy to a single install by setting an install id on a release using `nuon release create -i <install-id> 
-c <component>`.

### What if my customer wants monthly, or quarterly updates?

You can support custom update schedules using our API, or SDKs. We do plan on adding better support for this 
functionality, so if you would like this, please [get in touch](mailto:team@nuon.co).

### My customer wants a VPC deployment, do you support this?

Yes, we support VPC deployments with all of our common sandbox templates. We recommend testing your app with a 
fully-managed sandbox and using that for POCs.

In practice, we have found most production installs require a customer provider VPC.

## Pricing

### How does usage work?

We believe that all installs should be free, and want to encourage each of our customers to offer BYOC to their entire 
user base.

We charge based on runner minutes, which are metered when the runner is executing scripts to power day-2 operations. 
This includes custom diagnostics, logs, metrics and other import jobs.

### Do you offer discounts for OSS companies?

Yes, if you are an OSS company, please [reach out to us](mailto:team@nuon.co) to share more about your use case. On a 
case by case basis we can offer custom annual contracts for large scale usage.

### Do you offer an annual discount?

Yes, we offer annual contracts for companies planning for more than 25 production installs.

### Won't Nuon get too expensive if I offer it to my entire customer base?

As you build out your day-2 tooling on top of Nuon, you can optimize cost by controlling how much visibility, alerting 
and monitoring your configure for each install.

We can work with you to create custom annual contracts, and optimize your Nuon runner minute budget.
