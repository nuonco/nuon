description: "Manage your application configuration using Terraform"
---

This document includes details and best practices for managing your Nuon application configuration, using Terraform. Nuon is a standard terraform provider, and can be incorporated in your organization's Terraform tool chain. This document is primarily targeted at new terraform users.

## Why Terraform?

We opted to use Terraform as our primary configuration language, to help facilitate the natural evolution of application
lifecycles. As your application evolves, and things such as new helm charts, terraform code and images are added,
managing your Nuon configuration to map these to your app is a natural fit.

Furthermore, our Terraform provider allows us to easily version features and ensure a quality user experience while
iterating the platform quickly.

<Note>
We are planning on adding config file support, via a `nuon.yml` config file. If you would prefer this to manage your Nuon config, [please reach out](mailto:team@nuon.co).
</Note>

## Setup Nuon Terraform Provider

Currently, our [Terraform provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/nuonco/nuon/latest/docs) is the preferred way of managing your application config.

To apply your application config using terraform, you must set both an api token, and an org ID for authentication.

To set your `api_token`:
1. Fetch an api token using `nuon api-token`.
1. Export `NUON_API_TOKEN=token` _or_ use the `api_token` variable on the provider.

<CodeGroup>
```hcl providers.tf
provider "nuon" {
  api_token = "your-api-token"
}
```
```hcl versions.tf
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.3.7"

  required_providers {
    nuon = {
      source  = "nuonco/nuon"
      version = ">= 0.8.0"
    }
  }
}
```
</CodeGroup>

## Nuon Terraform vs App Terraform

Your Nuon application config in Terraform, is _only_ for configuring your Nuon app and any installs you are managing for
customers or testing purposes. The Nuon terraform provider _only_ interacts with, and manages your tenant on our api. It
does not directly interact with your customers, or application code.

Nuon also supports a [terraform component](./terraform-components), which allows you to connect your existing
application terraform to any Nuon app. These terraform components will be deployed as part of your application in an
install.

## Terraform State Management

We recommend setting up some form of [remote terraform state](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/state/remote) management, to prevent your Nuon configuration from being
leaked, and to prevent conflicting changes.

There are many best practices around state management online, and this is beyond the scope of this article. However, for teams that are new to Terraform, we recommend one of the following state backends to get started:

* [Hashicorp Terraform Cloud](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/terraform)
* [SpaceLift](https://spacelift.io/)
