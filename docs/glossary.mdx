## Org
A Org is basically your Nuon workspace where you and your team can configure your application and deliver it to each of your customers' cloud accounts. 

### Sandbox Org
A Sandbox Org is identical to a regular Org except it doesn't create cloud resources or actually deploy any software. You can use a Sandbox Org to test out different configurations or processes for delivering your software.

### VCS Connection

Version Control System Connection is the connection between you're Nuon Org and a VCS (currently we only support GitHub). Connecting your Org to a VCS like GitHub lets you deliver your application to your customers' cloud using your existing codebases and development processes (e.g. deploying after successful git merge).

## App
An App is a collection of software and infrastructure configurations that can be used to deliver your application to each of your customers' cloud. You can have as many Apps as you need and each App has it's own Components and Installs

## Component
Components are the configurations that represent the different parts that make up your App. For example your App might have one Component for the infrastructure and another or the software. Components can be containers or Helm Charts, used to run jobs or provision infrastructure resources with Terraform.

## Install
An Install is a cloud account where your App will be released, Installs are one to one with your customers and run isolated version of your application.

## Build
A Build is a packaged component ready to be Released. Builds may fail during creation and have logs to inspect via the CLI. Under the hood a Build is an OCI artifact that Nuon will sync with each Install. 

## Deploy
A Deploy is created when Nuon tries to run a Build on an Install. Similar to Builds, Deploys can fail during release and have logs to inspect via the CLI. Deploys can only be created via a Release.

## Release
A Release is a collections of Deploys across one or more Installs and can roll out all at once or in steps.
