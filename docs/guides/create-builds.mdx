A build packages a component's source code into an OCI artifact, and stores it in your organization's local OCI registry. Each deploy of the component will begin by syncing a build artifact from the org registry to an install's registry.

## Creating a Build

Creating a build is simple.

```sh
nuon builds create -c {component_id}
```

## Monitoring Builds

Once a build has been created, you can view its status using the CLI.

```sh
nuon builds get -c {component_id} -b {build_id}
```

## Debugging Builds

If a build fails, you can look at the logs to see why.

```sh
nuon builds logs -c {component_id} -b {build_id}
```

<Note>
Build log retention is 24 hours, but you can still see metadata about the logs by passing in the `--json` flag.
</Note>

If the issue is not apparent from the logs, or there are no logs, look at the build plan for more information. A plan is created for each build, and it contains all the information used to execute the build job.

<Tip>
The build plan is a JSON object, so we recommend using [JQ](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) to format it for readability.
</Tip>

```sh
nuon builds print-plan -c {component_id} -b {build_id} | jq
```
