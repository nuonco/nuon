  'Use your own IAM roles with customers, using install access delegation'

Set up a custom IAM role that customer's can grant access to, instead of using
the Nuon built in roles.

<Note>
  This feature is still in Beta, and currently can only be turned on by the Nuon
  team internally.
</Note>

## What Is Install Access Delegation

By default, Nuon installs require that the customer grant one time access to one
or more Nuon accounts to setup the install. This is done via cross account IAM,
by establishing a trust relationship with two Nuon AWS Accounts:

- `814326426574` - our sandbox provisioner account
- `007754799877` - our runner provisioner account

If you would rather not have your customers grant access to a Nuon account, and
instead use your own, you can set up delegation.

This requires setting up an IAM role that your customer grant's access to, which
allows Nuon to access it. When an install is created, Nuon will automatically
use your IAM role to access permissions for the customer account.

## Setup Delegation

To setup delegation for your application, you will need to create a new IAM role
that your customer's grant access to, _instead_ of granting access to Nuon
default IAM roles.

Currently, for GovCloud installs, you must also setup a user and share static
credentials to configure your app.

## Delegation Role Setup

You can use
[our published terraform module](https://github.com/nuonco/terraform-aws-install-access-delegation)
to create a delegation IAM role, that will grant Nuon the ability to provision
installs.

<CodeGroup>
```hcl module
module "delegation" {
  source = "nuonco/install-access-delegation/aws"
  name = "your-app"
  enable_support_access = true
}
```
</CodeGroup>

Please export the `iam_role_arn` and share that with the Nuon team to configure
your app.

<Note>
  We recommend enabling support access, so we can help you debug your delegation
  role while setting up your application.
</Note>

### Manual Setup

To manually setup IAM Role Delegation, you can follow these steps from the admin
console.

1. Create the following IAM policy. It will be attached to the IAM role you
   create in the next step.

```json
{
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Action": ["sts:AssumeRole"],
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ],
  "Version": "2012-10-17"
}
```

2. Create an IAM role in your own account, designed for cross-account access.
   This is sometimes under the "Custom Trust Policy" option. We'll refer to this
   as the "IAM delegate role". Attach the policy from step 1 and the following
   custom cross-account trust policy to your IAM delegate role. This will grant
   _nuon_ access to assume and use it:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::676549690856:root"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    },
    {
      "Sid": "",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::007754799877:root"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    },
    {
      "Sid": "",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::814326426574:root"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    },
    {
      "Sid": "",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::766121324316:root"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
```

3. Export the ARN of your IAM role. If you are using gov cloud, see the
   following section. Otherwise, you can set this value in the
   `aws_delegation_iam_role_arn` field of the `[sandbox]` section of your
   application configuration and `sync` your application.

4. You can follow the IAM role setup in your installers, terraform and other
   places by simply substituting the ARN roles in the
   [default](https://github.com/nuonco/sandboxes/blob/main/aws-ecs/artifacts/trust.json)
   trust relationships for your sandbox, with your delegation IAM role arn.

<Note>
  The "Create IAM policies with CloudFormation" section of the hosted installers
  will automatically work with delegated permissions, after they have been set
  up.
</Note>

### GovCloud Setup

You can support GovCloud installs using install access delegation. This requires
creating a delegation similar to the previous section, and creating a static
user which has access to that role, and sharing static credentials with Nuon to
use it.

<Note>
  If you create a delegation role using our terraform module, you only need do
  create the static user and credentials in the second half of this guide.
</Note>

First, create a delegation role to control access to customer installs:

1. Create an IAM role in your own account, designed for cross-account access.
   This role must have the following IAM policy attached to it:

```json
{
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Action": ["sts:AssumeRole"],
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ],
  "Version": "2012-10-17"
}
```

1. Export the ARN of your IAM role, and share with the Nuon team to configure
   delegation for your application.
1. Publish your account IAM role in your installer, docs or wherever else
   customer's are installing your application.
1. You can follow the IAM role setup in your installers, terraform and other
   places by simply substituting the ARN roles in the
   [default](https://github.com/nuonco/sandboxes/blob/main/aws-ecs/artifacts/trust.json)
   trust relationships for your sandbox, with your delegation IAM role arn.

Next, create a user in AWS with this role, and export static credentials to
setup delegation:

1. Visit the [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com) and Navigate to
   **IAM** -> **Users** and **Create**.
   ![export creds](/images/guides/install-access-delegation-create-user.png)
1. Create a user, _without_ console access.
1. Create a policy, and grant access for this user to assume your IAM role, by
   using the following JSON and substituting your IAM role ARN.

```json
{
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Action": ["sts:AssumeRole"],
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": "<your-iam-role-arn>"
    }
  ],
  "Version": "2012-10-17"
}
```

1. Once your user has been created, click into the detail page and click "Create
   Access Key" at the top, and click "Command Line Access".
   ![export creds](/images/guides/install-access-delegation-creds.png)
1. Copy the `AccessKeyID` and `SecretAccessKey`, and securely share them, with
   the Nuon team.
1. Share your IAM Role ARN with the Nuon team.
   ![export creds](/images/guides/install-access-delegation-creds-export.png)

<Note>
  This is just a temporary solution until Nuon properly provisions a GovCloud
  environment, at which point we will switch to using cross-account trust
  policies for gov cloud, instead of static credentials.
</Note>

## Install Access

If you are using delegation for your application, your customer's will need to
set the `delegation_role_arn` when creating an install.

If you are provisioning the IAM role with access via terraform, make sure to add
the `delegation_role_arn` field:

<CodeGroup>
```hcl
module "delegation_access" {
  source = "nuonco/install-access/aws"
  sandbox = "aws-ecs"
  prefix = "your-app-install-access"
  enable_support_access = false
  delegation_role_arn = <your-delegation-role>
}
```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
  This is going to be automated via our installers, for 1-click Cloudformation
  Role Creation soon.
