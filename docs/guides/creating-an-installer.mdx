In this guide we'll cover what an Installer is, how to create one and how to use it to onboard your customers.

<Note>
This guide assumes you have a working configuration of your Nuon App.

Learn more about [App configuration](/guides/apps) or try the [quickstart guide](/get-started/quickstart).
</Note>

## What is an App Installer?

An App Installer or Installer will create a public web page for your application complete with everything needed for your customers to create BYOC Installs of your App. Think of an Installer like a [Stripe checkout page](https://stripe.com/payments/checkout), you add your application's branding and information, and Nuon will create a self service landing page that will provision Installs of your App in your customers' cloud account.

## Creating an Installer

<Warning>
  If your using a sandbox Org you can still create an Installer but it will not provision resources or deploy software.
</Warning>

To create an Installer we'll use Terraform and the [Nuon Terraform provider](/terraform-provider).

To use the Nuon Terraform provider on your local machine you'll need an API token and the Org and App IDs you want to work with. There is a good chance you're already logged in with an active session via the [CLI](/cli) and if that is the case you should be good to go because our Terraform provider will use the same config.

You can view your current session config via the CLI.

```sh
nuon orgs print-config
```

If you don't have a current valid CLI session you can create one by logging in, select an Org and App then print the CLI config as above.

<CodeGroup>
```sh Login to Nuon
nuon login
```

```sh Select an Org
nuon orgs select
```

```sh Select an App
nuon apps select
```

```sh Print the CLI config
nuon orgs print-config
```
</CodeGroup>

Now that you have a valid session you can create your Installer using Terraform.

<Warning>You will not be able to change the slug later.</Warning>

<CodeGroup>

```hcl my_installer.tf
resource "nuon_app_installer" "main" {
  app_id = nuon_app.main.id
  name = var.app_name
  description = "${var.app_name} installer"
  slug = nuon_app.main.id

  documentation_url = "<url to your docs>"
  community_url = "<url to your community>"
  homepage_url = "<url to your homepage>"
  github_url = "<url to your github>"
  logo_url = "<url to your logo>"
  demo_url = "<url to a demo video (youtube, vimeo, wistia, loom, etc)>"
}
```

```sh cURL
curl --request POST \
  --url https://ctl.prod.nuon.co/v1/apps/{your_app_id}/installer \
  --header 'Authorization: <your_api_token>' \
  --header 'X-Nuon-Org-ID: <your_org_id>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "description": "<describe your application>",
  "links": {
    "community": "<url your community page>",
    "demo": "<url to a demo video (youtube, vimeo, wistia, loom, etc)>",
    "documentation": "<url to your docs>",
    "github": "<url to your github>",
    "homepage": "<url to your homepage>",
    "logo": "<url to your logo>"
  },
  "name": "<name of your application>",
  "slug": "<path you want your installer to live>"
}'
```
</CodeGroup>

If Terraform plan / apply is successful you can now view your Installers page at `https://app.nuon.co/installer/<your-installer-slug>`.

## On-boarding customers using the landing page

At this point you should have a landing page for your Installer that you're happy with that you can test. If you already have a ARN for a test IAM Policy you can go ahead and fill out the form in step 2 to provision the Install. If you need to create a IAM Policy for a test AWS account you can follow one of the options in step 1 of the landing page.

<Info>Read more about [IAM Policies](/guides/install-access-permissions) and [creating Installs](/guides/create-installs) if you're new to working with Installs outside of a sandbox Org.</Info>

After submitting the provision Install form you'll be redirected to a status page for the Install you just created (e.g. `https://app.nuon.co/installer/<your-installer-slug>/<customer-installer-name>`).

Depending on the App configuration the Install should be provisioned in 1-30 minutes, once the Install is active and running your application the status page should change to a green "active" status.
