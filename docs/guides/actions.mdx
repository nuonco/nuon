Actions allows you to define and remotely execute custom workflows in installs. You can automate common tasks, implement healthchecks, and even automate runbooks to handle incidents.

# Configuring Workflows

Action workflows can be configured in your app's TOML config. For example, to define an HTTP healthcheck:

<CodeGroup>
```toml actions/http_healthcheck.toml
#:schema https://api.nuon.co/v1/general/config-schema?type=action

name    = "http_healthcheck"
timeout = "0m15s"

[[triggers]]
type          = "cron"
cron_schedule = "*/5 * * * *"

[[triggers]]
type = "manual"

[[steps]]
name    = "healthcheck"
command = "./healthcheck"

[steps.public_repo]
repo      = "nuonco/actions"
branch    = "main"
directory = "common"

[steps.env_vars]
ENDPOINT             = "https://your-app.{{.nuon.install.sandbox.outputs.public_domain.name}}"
METHOD               = "HEAD"
EXPECTED_STATUS_CODE = "200"
```

```toml actions/<your-action>.toml
#:schema https://api.nuon.co/v1/general/config-schema

version      = "v1"
description  = "Your app on AWS."
display_name = "Your App"

[[actions]]
source = "./actions/alb_healthcheck.toml"
```
</CodeGroup>

Once configured and synced, you will see the workflow in the "Actions" tab for your app.

Following that example, we can describe the parts of a workflow.

## Timeout

Each workflow must have a timeout limiting how long it can run. The maxiumum allowed timeout is 30 minutes. Timeouts must be provided as valid Golang time.Duration strings.

The example workflow will timeoute after 15 seconds, more than enough time to make a simple HTTP request.

## Triggers

Actions can be triggered manually, on a cron, or by install events. You can define multiple triggers for an action.

| Trigger Type | Attributes | Description |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| **manual** | | Manually triggered the CLI or Vendor Dashboard |
| **cron** | cron_schedule | Scheduled to run at specific time intervals defined by a crontab |
| **pre-sandbox-run** | | Executes before a sandbox run begins |
| **post-sandbox-run** | | Executes after a sandbox run completes |
| **pre-deploy** | | Executes before a component deploy begins |
| **post-deploy** | | Executes after a component deploy completes |

The example action defines two triggers. It will run every five minutes, and can also be triggered manually at any time.

```toml actions/<action-name>.toml
[[triggers]]
type          = "cron"
cron_schedule = "*/5 * * * *"

[[triggers]]
type = "manual"
```

## Steps

Each step in an action requires a command to be run. You can optionally load a script from a repo and provide env vars to configure the environment the command will run in.

The example action is pretty simple, so it has only one step. It loads a curl script from our [open-source repo of commonly-used scripts](https://github.com/nuonco/actions), and sets a few env vars to configure it.

```toml actions/<action-name>.toml
[[steps]]
name    = "healthcheck"
command = "./healthcheck"

[steps.public_repo]
repo      = "nuonco/actions"
branch    = "main"
directory = "common"

[steps.env_vars]
ENDPOINT             = "https://your-app.{{.nuon.install.sandbox.outputs.public_domain.name}}"
METHOD               = "HEAD"
EXPECTED_STATUS_CODE = "200"
```

# Monitoring Workflow Runs

Actions workflow runs can be monitored on the "Actions" tab in each Install. You can see a list of all workflow runs, and inspect each run to see logs, what triggered the run, and whether is succeeded or not.
