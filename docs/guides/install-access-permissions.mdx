Nuon's [Install](/concepts/installs) process creates an AWS CloudFormation stack where when run by the customer, creates an install role with policies for the Nuon [Runner](/concepts/runners) to provision, maintain and deprovision the [Sandbox](/concepts/sandboxes).

During the Install process in the Nuon Dashboard, the user opens CloudFormation stack in their AWS account, which creates the VM that runs the Runner with the aforementioned policies.

[Components](/concepts/components) and [Actions](/concepts/actions) include additional roles and policies required for the Runner to deploy them.

Previous releases of Nuon required that the user had a cross-account IAM role in their AWS account that granted access to Nuon accounts, which Nuon used to create the Install. This required manually running AWS CLI commands or using Terraform.
