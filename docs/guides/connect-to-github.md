# Connect to GitHub

## At a glance

In this guide, we'll show how to connect an application to your GitHub account so you can configure components using code from your private repositories.

## Connect your application to GitHub.

You'll likely want to run software from your own GitHub repositories. To enable this, you'll need to connect your application to GitHub. Start by clicking the "Connect to GitHub" button in the top right corner of the Overview page. You'll be sent to GitHub and asked to grant Nuon access to your repositories. Once you've granted Nuon access, we'll direct you to the Nuon dashboard. You can verify the connection has been established by clicking the "Settings" button and viewing the "Connections" tab.
