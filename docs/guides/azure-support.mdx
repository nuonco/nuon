Azure has not been publicly announced yet, however this guide is a starting point to create an Azure BYOC app using Nuon.

## Create Service Principal

In order for Nuon to provision an install on Azure, it must be given access via a [Service Principal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-terraform?tabs=bash#create-a-service-principal) that has been assigned the [Owner](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles/general#owner) role.

You can create a service principal using the [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/get-started-with-azure-cli). First, log into the account you want to install into.

```sh
$ az login
```

List your accounts to get the subscription ID.

```sh
$ az account list
```

Use the subscription ID to create a Service Principal.

```sh
$ az ad sp create-for-rbac --name <principal-name> --role Owner --scopes /subscriptions/<subscription-id>
```

## Sandboxes

We support two sandboxes for Azure:

* [Azure AKS](/guides/sandboxes#azure-aks) - A fully managed app sandbox that provisions both the VPN and AKS cluster.
* [Azure AKS BYOVPN](/guides/sandboxes#azure-aks-byovpn) - A shared-responsibility sandbox that provisions the AKS cluster in a customer provided VPN.

We build these sandboxes using the standard [Azure modules](https://github.com/Azure/terraform-azure-modules).

Reference the [Sandboxes Guide](./sandboxes) for more information on using sandboxes.
