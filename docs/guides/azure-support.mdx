Azure has not been publicly announced yet, however this guide is a starting point to create an Azure BYOC app using Nuon.

## App Sandbox

Azure sandboxes can be found in our [public sandboxes repo](https://github.com/nuonco/sandboxes). We support two sandboxes:

* `azure-aks` - a fully managed app sandbox that provisions the VPN/AKS cluster
* `azure-aks-byovpn` - a shared-responsibility sandbox that uses a customer provided VPN.

## Usage

To create an Azure application, use the `azure-aks` runner-type and an `azure` sandbox.

## Sandboxes

We are offering two `azure` sandboxes:

* turnkey / default - creates a VPN and cluster for a fully managed install.
* byo-vpn - requires the customer to provide a VPN.

We build these sandboxes using the standard [Azure modules](https://github.com/Azure/terraform-azure-modules).

## Create Service Principal

Installs are created and provisioned by offering a [Service Principal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-terraform?tabs=bash#create-a-service-principal), that `nuon` can use to provision the sandbox.

To create an Azure service principal locally:

```bash
$ az login
$ az account list (to get the subscription ID)
$ az ad sp create-for-rbac --name <name> --role Owner --scopes /subscriptions/<subscription-id>
```

In order to fully provision the application, the principal must be created with the `Contributor` role.
