## The Sandbox

## Updates

Once your customer has their install, you will need to update it. Ensuring clarity around changes to a customer's install is key to building and maintaining trust.

You can use our CLI from your CI system to automate creating new versions of your app, and releasing them to customers.

### Key Questions

- How often will you need to update customer installs?
- How often does each customer want their install updated? Will there be a a lot of variation between customers?
- Can the app be updated in a fully-automated fashion? Will there ever be manual steps required?
- Will my customers need to take any action as part of an update?

### Checklist

- CI
  - flow for creating a new version of your app
  - flow for creating a new release
- actions
  - database migrations
  - scripts to handle updating other types of stateful resources

## Deleting

If you do need to uninstall your app from a customer's account, make sure the process can be executed smoothly.
You want to avoid leaving resources lingering after deletion is complete.
Your primary tool here will probably be Actions.

### Key Questions

- Are any resources troublesome to manage with infra-as-code? Databases, for example, are commonly challenging to manage using infra-as-code tools.
- What resources may be created dynamically after installation? Kubernetes operators are a typical culprit here, often creating resources outside of kubernetes that are not managed by your own infra-as-code.
- Are all resources created tagged? If so, even if they are created outside of your infra-as-code, you can find and deletem them using an action.
- What race conditions may happen while deleting resources? Are component dependencies enough to handle these? Again, you can implement work-arounds here using actions.

### Checklist

- runbooks
  - customer uninstallation guide
  - vendor uninstallation guide
- actions
  - cleanup lingering resources based on tags
