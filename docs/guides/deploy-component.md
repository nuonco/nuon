## View a Running Instance of a Component

Once you’ve deployed your component, you can view the running instance of the component on any of your installs. To do this:

1.  Go to the Install page, and click one of the provisioned installs.
2.  The Install detail panel opens, showing a list of all component instances. If the instance’s status is active, click the URL to open a new tab with the running component instance in the install.
