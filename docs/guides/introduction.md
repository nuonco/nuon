-   **Create an organization** - Sign in to Nuon, and create an organization for your company.
-   **Create an application** - Create your first application by giving it a name. You can optionally connect the application to a GitHub repo containing your app's components.
-   **Add a component** - Specify the source and deployment details for all the components in your application.
-   **Create an install** - Create an install to run your application on your customer’s cloud account. This creates the sandbox in which your app's components will be deployed.
