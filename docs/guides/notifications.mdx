We support sending slack notifications for apps and orgs.

## Slack Webhook Notifications

You can receive notifications for events in your application in slack, by creating a channel and generating a [Slack 
Incoming Webhook URL](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks).

To add notifications for an app, update the app metadata to set the webhook url:

```toml nuon.<your-app>.toml
slack_webhook_url = "<slack-webhook-url>"
```


<Note>
We have many additional events internally that can be sent as notifications. If you would like additional notifications, 
please <a mailto="team@nuon.co">let us know</a>.
</Note>

## Supported Events

Currently, the following notifications are supported:

* `App Sync Error` - get a notification for any app sync error.
* `Install Created` - notification for any new install created.

## Org Events

We support sending additional events for an entire org, but do not (yet) expose a way to manage these directly. If you 
would like to setup notifications for your entire org, please reach out and we can set this up internally.
