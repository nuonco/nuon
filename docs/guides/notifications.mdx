We support sending slack notifications for [Apps](/concepts/apps) and Orgs.

## Slack Webhook Notifications

You can receive notifications for events in your application in slack, by creating a channel and generating a [Slack 
Incoming Webhook URL](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks).

To add notifications for an App, update the App metadata to set the webhook url:

```toml metadata.toml
slack_webhook_url = "<slack-webhook-url>"
```

We have many additional events internally that can be sent as notifications. If you would like additional notifications, 
please [let us know](https://nuon.co/contact-us).

## Supported Events

Currently, the following notifications are supported:

* `App Sync Error` - get a notification for any [App](/concepts/apps) sync error.
* `Install Created` - notification for any new [Install](/concepts/installs) created.

## Org Events

We support sending additional events for an entire Org, but do not (yet) expose a way to manage these directly. If you 
would like to setup notifications for your entire Org, please reach out and we can set this up internally.
