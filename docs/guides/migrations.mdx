Migrations can be added to a BYOC application to run operational scripts, make database schema changes and more.

While Nuon does not enforce how migrations are dispatched for an install, this document outlines several common
  approaches.

## Kubernetes Applications

If your application is using Kubernetes, and you are packaging via Helm you can use a [chart hook](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts_hooks/) to execute a migrations script.

For example in your helm chart:

<CodeGroup>
```yml helm_chart
---
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: migrations
  namespace: {{ .Release.Namespace }}
  annotations:
    "helm.sh/hook": post-upgrade
    "helm.sh/hook-weight": "-5"
    "helm.sh/hook-delete-policy": before-hook-creation,hook-succeeded
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      restartPolicy: Never
      containers:
        - name: migrations
          image: "{{ .Values.image.repository }}:{{ .Values.image.tag }}"
          command:
            - /bin/service
            - migrations
```
</CodeGroup>

Then, when Nuon installs or upgrades the chart in your install, the hooks will be executed:

<CodeGroup>
```toml nuon.your-app.toml
[[components]]
name = "helm"
type = "helm_chart"
chart_name = "helm"

[components.connected_repo]
directory = "k8s"
repo = "your-org/repo"
branch = "main"
```
</CodeGroup>

## Job Components

[Job components](./job-components) can be used to run any script within a container image as part of your install. They
work just like any other component, and give you access to do powerful things such as run schema migrations, batch jobs
and more.

To use job components to manage migrations, first start by adding a container image or docker build component that combines your migration tool, and migrations:

<CodeGroup>
```toml nuon.your-app.toml
[[components]]
name = "migrations_image"
type = "docker_build"
dockerfile = "Dockerfile.migrations"

[components.connected_repo]
directory = "migrations"
repo = "your-org/repo"
branch = "main"
```
</CodeGroup>

Next, declare a job config that executes your migrations image.

<CodeGroup>
```toml nuon.your-app.toml
[[components]]
name = "migrations_job"
type = "job"
image_url = "{{.nuon.components.migrations_image.image.repository.uri}}"
tag = "{{.nuon.components.migrations_image.image.tag}}"
cmd = ["/bin/service"]
args = ["migrate"]

[[components.env_vars]]
DB_URL = "database-url"
```
</CodeGroup>

When the job component is released, the script will be executed just like any other component deploy.

This approach can be used with common migration tools including:

1. [Atlas](https://atlasgo.io/)
1. [Flyway](https://flywaydb.org/)

You can use an existing application container, and use the job component to run a command such as `npm run migrations`
or `rake db:migrate` depending on your framework.
