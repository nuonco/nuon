Container images allow you to import prebuilt container images from public sources, and private ECR repositories.

## Container Images vs Docker Build images

Container images are used to import _prebuilt_ images, that have already been pushed to either a public registry, or a private ECR repository.

### When to use a docker build component

Use a docker build component if:

* your container build process does not do any additional scanning/processing on your built container images
* you do not need to access any internal resources during the build process
* you want to get started faster

### When to use a container image component

* you want to leverage public images
* you post process or scan built container images
* your build process accesses internal resources (such as a private dependency registry)
* you value building once, and using everywhere for consistency purposes

<Note>
If you have private prebuilt images in a registry other than AWS ECR, that you would like to use, [please get in touch](mailto:team@nuon.co)!

## Configuring a container image component

### Using a Public Image

To use a public image from any container registry, configure the `public` block.

```toml components/public_image.toml
#:schema https://api.nuon.co/v1/general/config-schema?type=container-image
name   = "public"
type   = "container_image"

[public]
image_url = "kennethreitz/httpbin"
tag       = "latest"
```

### Using a Private AWS ECR Image

To use an image from a private ECR registry, configure the `aws_ecr` block.

```toml components/ecr_image.toml
#:schema https://api.nuon.co/v1/general/config-schema?type=container-image
name   = "ecr"
type   = "container_image"

[aws_ecr]
image_url    = "123927561584.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/repo-name"
tag          = "latest"
region       = "us-west-2"
iam_role_arn = "arn:aws:iam::123927561584:role/nuon-container-image-access"
```

To use an AWS ECR image, [please follow the directions](#ecr-access-iam-role) to setup an IAM role, granting access to Nuon to pull the image.

## Deployments

Container image Components _cannot_ be deployed directly in a customer install. When an image is released, it will be _synced_
into the customer install and made available to other Components via [variables](/guides/using-variables).

To deploy a Container image component, reference the image from a Helm component or Terraform component:

```toml components/eks_deployment.toml
#:schema https://api.nuon.co/v1/general/config-schema?type=helm
name       = "eks_deployment"
type       = "helm_chart"
chart_name = "<your-app>"

[connected_repo]
repo      = "<your-app>"
directory = "components/helm-chart"
branch    = "main"

[values]
"env.IMAGE_TAG"        = "{{.nuon.components.app_image.image.tag}}"
"env.IMAGE_REPOSITORY" = "{{.nuon.components.app_image.image.repository.uri}}"
```

```toml components/ecs_service.toml
#:schema https://api.nuon.co/v1/general/config-schema?type=terraform
name              = "ecs_service"
type              = "terraform_module"
terraform_version = "v1.6.3"

[connected_repo]
repo      = "<your-app>"
directory = "components/ecs-service"
branch    = "main"

[vars]
"image_tag"        = "{{.nuon.components.app_image.image.tag}}"
"image_repository" = "{{.nuon.components.app_image.image.repository.uri}}"
```

```toml components/eks_job.toml
#:schema https://api.nuon.co/v1/general/config-schema?type=action
name      = "eks_job"
type      = "job"
image_url = "{{.nuon.components.app_image.image.repository.uri}}"
tag       = "{{.nuon.components.app_image.image.tag}}"
```

## Image Syncing

When a Container image component is released, Nuon will automatically sync the image into the end customer account. This
image is stored in a local registry that is provisioned in the customer account.

Nuon image syncing allows you to sync images into accounts, without worrying about cross account permissions, registry
authentication or publishing public images. Any `Dockerfile` in a repo can be built, and synced.

The sync process works by creating a 1-time authentication flow that grants the install runner access to pull the image
from the org data plane, and copy it into the local registry.

## AWS ECR Access IAM Role

To use a private AWS ECR image, you must create an IAM role that grants Nuon access to pull your container image. When
building your component, `nuon` will automatically assume the role and pull the image from your build runner.

The easiest way to setup an IAM role to configure your component with is using our [Terraform Module](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/nuonco/ecr-access/aws).

```hcl
module "nuon_ecr_access" {
  source  = "nuonco/ecr-access/aws"

  repository_arns = ["<repository-arn>"]
}

output "ecr_access_iam_role" {
  value = module.nuon_ecr_access.ecr_access_iam_role
}
```

<Note>
If you are having trouble finding the repository ARN in the AWS console, you can run `aws ecr describe-repositories` to
  print the ARNs of all repositories in your current context.
</Note>

## Importing Images Outside of AWS ECR

We currently _only_ support public container images and private container images pushed to AWS ECR private registries.

If your registry is supported by AWS ECR's [pull through
  cache](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/pull-through-cache-working.html), the easiest way to
  import the images into Nuon is to setup a pull through cache and configure your container image to use it.

This works for [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/), [Github Container Registry](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry) and [Microsoft Azure Container Registry](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/container-registry).

<Note>
If you would like to use a different private container registry than AWS ECR, we would love to know more. Please [get in touch](mailto:team@nuon.co) to tell us more about your use case.
