## Deploy

Beyond just deploying all the components, you should think about the user experience of installing your app.
This is where the rubber meets the road on providing a "SaaS-like" experience.
It should be clear to your customer what is going on at each step of the installation process, and when the installation is complete and their install is ready to use.

### Key Questions

- Will installation be self-serve by the customer or handled by an internal team? This will define what runbooks you need.
- Will there be manual steps needed after installation? If you can't automate every step, you can still document them in runbooks, and provide actions to execute scripts.
- How will your customer know when the app is ready to use? You can use actions to implement a readiness check.
- How will your customer know where to go to access the app? You can render component outputs in a runbook to provide a URL.

### Checklist

- runbooks
  - customer installation instructions for self-serve installation
  - vendor installation instructions for managed installation
- actions
  - readiness check
