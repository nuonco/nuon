## Why Dependencies?

Most applications have either explicit or implicit dependencies between the different components that comprise them.

For example, given an app that comprises a [Helm chart](/guides/helm-chart-components) component and a [Terraform component](./terraform-components):

```toml nuon.<your-app>.toml
[[components]]
name       = "helm"
type       = "helm_chart"
chart_name = "helm"
[components.connected_repo]
directory = "components/helm"
repo      = "<your-org>/<your-repo>"
branch    = "main"
[components.values]
database_url = "{{.nuon.components.database.outputs.database_url}}"

[[components]]
name              = "database"
type              = "terraform_module"
terraform_version = "v1.6.3"
[components.connected_repo]
directory = "components/database"
repo      = "<your-org>/<your-repo>"
branch    = "main"
```

In this example, the `helm` chart requires that the database be provisioned _before_ it is deployed. Otherwise, the
database will not exist yet, and the `database_url` output will not be defined.

When deprovisioning the install, the `helm` chart must be deprovisioned _before_ the database, to ensure no active
dependencies exist, preventing the database from being shut down.

## Defining Component Dependencies

To support this, you can define one or more dependencies on each component, telling Nuon what other components it relies on.
Nuon will use your configuration to build a dependency graph, to ensure components are provisioned and deprovisioned in the correct order.

<Warning>
The dependency graph is directed and _acyclic_, which means circular dependencies are not supported.
Nuon checks for cycles and will error if you attempt to define one.
</Warning>

Dependencies will be inferred from the order of the components in your app config file.
Every component will automatically depend on the component defined before it.
If you re-order the components in the file, the dependencies will be updated.

Taking the example above, you can make the Helm chart depend on the database by simply reversing their order in the file.

```toml
# Move the helm_chart component from up here...

[[components]]
name              = "database"
type              = "terraform_module"
terraform_version = "v1.6.3"
[components.connected_repo]
directory = "components/database"
repo      = "<your-org>/<your-repo>"
branch    = "main"

# to down here.
[[components]]
name       = "helm"
type       = "helm_chart"
chart_name = "helm"
[components.connected_repo]
directory = "components/helm"
repo      = "<your-org>/<your-repo>"
branch    = "main"
[components.values]
database_url = "{{.nuon.components.database.outputs.database_url}}"
```

## Install Provisioning

When an install is provisioned, Nuon will generate a graph of the app based on the defined dependencies.
Nuon will automatically deploy the _latest_ build of each component to the install. In the previous example, this means
that the database component would be deployed _before_ the Helm chart.

For example, when you create a new install, each component will automatically be deployed:

```sh
nuon installs create
```

To check the status of each component on the install:

```sh
nuon installs components
```

## Install Deprovisioning

When an install is deprovisioned, Nuon will generate a graph of all the deployed components on the install, and walk
them in reverse, to deprovision them properly. In the previous example, this means the helm component would be
deprovisioned _before_ the database.
