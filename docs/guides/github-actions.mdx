You can use GitHub Actions to automatically build and release your components as part of your workflow. This can be used
to update your Nuon applications, running in customer accounts alongside updating other platforms.

We offer the following actions:
- [Build](https://github.com/nuonco/actions-build)
- [Release](https://github.com/nuonco/actions-release)

Each GitHub action uses the [Nuon CLI](../cli) to perform operations. Please refer to [configuration](#configuration)
for details on configuring each action.

## Automatically Build Components

In order to update customer applications with the latest version of a component, it must be built first. You can
automatically build a component using GitHub actions.

To automatically build from an Action:
<CodeGroup>
```yaml build.yml
---
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Build
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        id: checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Build component
        id: build
        uses: nuonco/actions-build@v1
        with:
          api_token: ${{ secrets.nuon_api_token }}
          org: ${{ vars.nuon_org_id }}
          component_id: backend
```
</CodeGroup>

## Automatically Release Components

Release are used to update components in a Nuon application.

To automatically build _and_ release a component from an Action:
<CodeGroup>
```yaml build-and-release.yml
---
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Build
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        id: checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Build component
        id: build
        uses: nuonco/actions-build@v1
        with:
          api_token: ${{ secrets.nuon_api_token }}
          org: ${{ vars.nuon_org_id }}
          component_id: backend

      - name: Release
        id: release
        uses: nuonco/actions-release@v1
        with:
          api_token: ${{ secrets.nuon_api_token }}
          org: ${{ vars.nuon_org_id
          build_id: ${{ steps.build.outputs.build_id }}
```
</CodeGroup>

Please refer to [creating releases](./create-releases) for more details on releases.

## Configuration

Both an API token and an org ID are required to configure Nuon github actions. These can be fetched using the [Nuon CLI](../cli).

To fetch an API token:
```sh
$ nuon orgs current -j
```

To fetch the current org ID:
```sh
$ nuon orgs api-token -j
```

It is recommended to set the API token using a [GitHub Action secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions).

<Note>
If you do not yet have an org setup, please follow the [quickstart guide](/get-started/quickstart).
