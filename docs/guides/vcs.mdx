## At a glance

Connecting Nuon with your Version Control System (VCS) will give Nuon the ability to use your code when configuring your application. In this guide we'll use the [Nuon CLI](/cli) to connect your Nuon Org to a GitHub account or repository and verify the connection is working by listing the connected repositories.

<Note>
You may want to update an existing GitHub connection (e.g. add a new repository to the connection). To do this follow the steps below, make the updates with in the GitHub connection flow and your existing connection should be updated.
</Note>

## Select an Org

Because a VCS connection is scoped to your Nuon Org you'll need to login using the CLI and select the Org you want to use.

<CodeGroup>

```sh Login
nuon login
```

```sh Org select
nuon orgs select
```
</CodeGroup>

Alternatively if you already have an existing CLI session you can just verify the Org is correct before you start the connection flow.

```sh
nuon orgs current
```

## Start the connection flow

Now that you're logged in with a valid Org selected you'll want to kick off the GitHub connection flow with the CLI.

```sh
nuon orgs connect-github
```

This command will open a tab in your browser asking you to install [Nuon Connect](https://github.com/apps/nuon-connect) app into your GitHub account. 

## Select GitHub access

At this point you'll follow the GitHub connection flow, selecting an account to install Nuon Connect and selecting which repositories Nuon can have access to.

![Select repos](/images/guides/select-repo.png)
<sub>Select which repos Nuon Connect can have access to</sub>

After you've selected which repositories Nuon Connect can access you'll be redirected to the [Nuon web app](https://app.nuon.co). If the connection was a success you'll see either a success message or you'll be redirected back to the [Nuon web app](https://app.nuon.co) if you have an active web session.

## Verify connection works

At this point you can close the browser tab and verify everything is correct in the terminal via the CLI.

<CodeGroup>

```sh View connections 
nuon orgs list-vcs-connections
```

```sh View connected repositories
nuon orgs list-connected-repos
```
</CodeGroup>

If the connection was successful you should see a list on connected GitHub accounts and a list of connected repositories that you can now use to configure you're application in Nuon.
