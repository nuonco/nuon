## Overview

When creating an org, you have the option to create it in sandbox mode. This feature was added to facilitate testing app configs without the overhead of using real cloud resources.

An org in sandbox mode will simulate the provision of cloud resources on the backend. If a process has a step that interacts with a cloud platform, that step will be skipped, and the process will assume it succeeded. Otherwise everything will work exactly the same as in a real org.

## Limitations

You can use sandbox mode to test that your app configuration is valid, that variables are interpolating correctly, and that releases will work as intended. But, because sandbox mode doesn't interact with your target platform, it won't test your component or sandbox source code. We recommend testing the source code of each component beforehand as part of your CI process, as testing it by deploying all of your components to an install can be time-consuming and costly.
