The CLI is your primary interface to the Nuon platform.

## Installation

### Homebrew

We publish an official tap you can install with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

```sh
brew install nuonco/tap/nuon
```

After installation, you may need to refresh your shell session.

```sh
source ~/.bashrc # or ~/.zshrc, etc.
```

You can also enable autocomplete for you shell. Run `nuon completion` to see what shells we support.

```sh
source <(nuon completion <your-shell>)
```

### Manage Binaries Directly

If you are not using Homebrew, you can dowload the binaries for MacOS or Linux:

* `darwin_amd64`
* `darmin_arm64`
* `linux_arm`
* `linux_arm64`
* `linux_386`
* `linux_amd64`

Binaries are published to https://nuon-artifacts.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cli, and versioned by release. To download a
binary, first look up the current API version, and then download the current binary for your platform.

To look up the current API version:

```sh
curl https://ctl.prod.nuon.co/version
```

To download the binaries for a specific version, substitute the version and platform into the following URL: `https://nuon-artifacts.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cli/$VERSION/nuon_${PLATFORM}`

An example of downloading version `0.19.19` of the CLI for `darwin_arm64`:

```sh
wget -o nuon https://nuon-artifacts.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cli/0.19.19/nuon_darwin_arm64
```

Once the binary has been downloaded remember to make it executable.

```sh
chmod +x nuon
```

### Updates

We release new version of the CLI frequently, so we recommend updating it weekly.

### Debug Mode

In the case that something goes wrong, you can set the environment variable `NUON_DEBUG` to print verbose logs. These
can be helpful to share with us, while debugging any issues.

```sh
NUON_DEBUG=true nuon apps list
```
