The Nuon CLI is used to manage apps, create or debug installs and update components. The CLI is a go binary that does
not have any additional dependencies.

### Default CLI Installation

Install the CLI and refresh your shell session to get autocompletion.

<CodeGroup>
```sh install the CLI
echo "y" | /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://nuon-artifacts.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cli/install.sh)"
```

```sh refresh shell session
source ~/.bashrc # or ~/.zshrc, etc.
```
</CodeGroup>

Run `nuon` to verify it's installed and see all the sub-commands.

### Manage Binaries Directly

Binaries are published for the following OS and architecture combinations:

* `darwin_amd64`
* `darmin_arm64`
* `linux_arm`
* `linux_arm64`
* `linux_386`
* `linux_amd64`

Binaries are published to https://nuon-artifacts.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cli, and versioned by release. To download a
binary, first look up the current API version, and then download the current binary for your platform.

To look up the current API version:

<CodeGroup>
```sh curl
$ curl https://ctl.prod.nuon.co/version
{"git_ref":"8ebeb7e1","version":"0.19.19"}
```
</CodeGroup>

To download the binaries for a specific version, substitute the version and platform into the following URL: `https://nuon-artifacts.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cli/$VERSION/nuon_${PLATFORM}`


An example downloading the `0.19.19` version of the CLI for `darwin_arm64`:
<CodeGroup>
```sh curl
$ wget -o nuon https://nuon-artifacts.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cli/0.19.19/nuon_darwin_arm64
$ chmod +x nuon
```
</CodeGroup>

### Updates

We recommend updating the `nuon` CLI weekly, by re-downloading the binary or re-running the installation script.
