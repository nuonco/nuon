The CLI is your primary interface to the Nuon platform.

## Installation

### Homebrew

We publish an official tap you can install with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

<CodeGroup>
```sh install the CLI
brew install nuonco/tap/nuon
```

```sh refresh shell session
source ~/.bashrc # or ~/.zshrc, etc.
```
</CodeGroup>

Run `nuon` to verify it's installed and see all the sub-commands.

### Manage Binaries Directly

If you are not using Homebrew, you can dowload the binaries for MacOS or Linux:

* `darwin_amd64`
* `darmin_arm64`
* `linux_arm`
* `linux_arm64`
* `linux_386`
* `linux_amd64`

Binaries are published to https://nuon-artifacts.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cli, and versioned by release. To download a
binary, first look up the current API version, and then download the current binary for your platform.

To look up the current API version:

<CodeGroup>
```sh curl
$ curl https://ctl.prod.nuon.co/version
{"git_ref":"8ebeb7e1","version":"0.19.19"}
```
</CodeGroup>

To download the binaries for a specific version, substitute the version and platform into the following URL: `https://nuon-artifacts.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cli/$VERSION/nuon_${PLATFORM}`

An example downloading the `0.19.19` version of the CLI for `darwin_arm64`:
<CodeGroup>
```sh curl
$ wget -o nuon https://nuon-artifacts.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cli/0.19.19/nuon_darwin_arm64
$ chmod +x nuon
```
</CodeGroup>

### Updates

We recommend updating the `nuon` CLI weekly, by re-downloading the binary or re-running the installation script.

### Debug Mode

In the case that something goes wrong, you can set the environment variable `NUON_DEBUG` to print verbose logs. These
can be helpful to share with us, while debugging any issues.

<CodeGroup>
```sh nuon
$ NUON_DEBUG=true nuon apps list
```
</CodeGroup>
