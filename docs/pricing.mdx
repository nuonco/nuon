## Runner Usage

Each install is deployed with a Nuon managed runner, that is used to monitor, update and manage your application running 
in an end-customer's cloud account.

Nuon provides you the ability to collect logs, metrics and run custom diagnostic scripts to ensure your application is 
working. We charge by metering the usage of data transfer/storage and executing diagnostics.

| Unit | Description | Free Tier | Growth Tier | Business Tier |Enterprise Tier|

  for different application stacks and talk through different scenarios.

## Committed Services

We offer generous discounts for committed service usage on both a quarterly and annual basis. Committed services allow 
you to purchase usage units up front, and defaults to list prices for overages.

Please [contact us](mailto:sales@nuon.co) to learn more.

## Enterprise Contracts

We offer custom, case-by-case enterprise contracts and have several different options for larger commitments. Please 
[reach out](mailto:sales@nuon.co) to learn more.

## Self-Hosted / BYOC Deployments

In most cases, we recommend starting with [Install Access Delegation](/guides/install-access-delegation) to prevent 
customer's having to share one-time access with Nuon for installs.

However, for enterprise contracts we offer a self-hosted and BYOC deployment option for the Nuon platform.
