## Config Files


Before Nuon, creating a BYOC application took months, or even years. Using our [Terraform Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/nuonco/nuon/latest/docs), anyone can create a
BYOC application in a few hours - however, we knew we could make it even faster.

Today, we are happy to share that you can create BYOC apps with two simple commands:

<CodeGroup>
```nuon sh
$ nuon apps create --name=your-cool-app
$ nuon apps sync
```
</CodeGroup>

This is a HUGE deal, you can now experiment with different versions of your BYOC app (such as fully-managed, byo-vpc or
others), and get going in just a few minutes. All you need to do is modify the config file to point Nuon at the write
components, and we'll handle the rest. Yes, it's that easy.

Config files use TOML syntax, and allow you to define each part of your application, including installers, components,
sandboxes and more.

<CodeGroup>
```toml nuon.your-cool-app.toml
[[components]]
name = "toml_terraform"
type = "terraform_module"
terraform_version = "1.5.3"

[components.connected_repo]
directory = "infra"
repo = "powertoolsdev/mono"
branch = "main"

[[components.var]]
name = "AWS_REGION"
value = "{{.nuon.install.sandbox.account.region}}"

[[components.var]]
name = "ACCOUNT_ID"
value = "{{.nuon.install.sandbox.account.id}}"
```
</CodeGroup>

While some of you may still want to use Terraform to handle more complex applications (or multiple apps), we think these
  config files will be a lot faster for most people to onboard :).

Check our our [config docs](../guides/configuration-files) for more.

## Export Terraform

Under the hood, our config files generate Terraform, and use our Terraform provider to keep your app in sync. We went
ahead and exposed this generated terraform, in case you would like to migrate from config files to terraform.

To generate `terraform` json, simply run:

<CodeGroup>
```nuon sh
$ nuon apps export-terraform
```
</CodeGroup>

To work with this generated `terraform` json, simply write it to a file with a `.tf.json` suffix. All normal terraform
commands will work like usual:

<CodeGroup>
```nuon sh
$ nuon apps export-terraform > app.tf.json
$ terraform init
$ terraform plan
```
</CodeGroup>

## Coming Soon

As a teaser, we are heads down shipping an all new way to debug and manage Nuon installs. Early customer feedback has
been great, and we'll be sharing this with the world next week - stay tuned!
