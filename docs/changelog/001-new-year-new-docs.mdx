## Docs v2

Check out our new [docs site](https://docs.nuon.co)!

Back in August, we decided to rewrite our API (more about that
[here](https://www.nuon.co/post/how-we-rebuilt-our-api-using-long-lived-workflows)), and change our primary
configuration experience to be powered by our [Terraform
provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/nuonco/nuon/latest/docs). At the time, we knew that our docs
experience would need to be completely rethought, so we kicked the can down the road, and relied on our autogenerated
terraform and api documentation (and a whole lot of slack messages with early customers), to get by.

We recently decided that enough was enough, and that we needed to revisit our docs, to build a better experience for our users.

Our requirements for a new docs site were simple:

* integrate with our growing ecosystem of integrations (sdks, terraform provider and more)
* build an API portal + code samples right in
* be a "first class" part of our product, that we could iterate on and customize as needed

[Mintlify](https://mintlify.com/) proved to be the perfect solution and today, we are happy to announce our new docs
experience. You can head over to [docsannounce our new docs experience. You can head over to
[docs.nuon.co](https://docs.nuon.co) and go through our quickstart, api docs, and a growing number of guides on using
the platform.

We have a lot more coming here, but we hope you love this first version!

## CLI onboarding

As we have continued to iterate on our CLI, we have added more and more of our onboarding into it. Our north star is
that anyone can install our CLI with a single command, and setup their entire BYOC app in minutes. While we haven't gotten all the way there, this release introduces two new capabilities:

* login + signup
* github connection management

To create a new account using Nuon, just install our CLI and then run `nuon login`. We will automatically setup your account and log you in.

Once you have created your account, you can connect your Github org, so that your Nuon app can access components in private repos.

We have quite a bit more planned in our CLI to make managing your apps, debugging installs and more easier!
