## GitHub Actions

We now offer GitHub Actions that enable you to automatically update your applications.

* [actions-build](https://github.com/nuonco/actions-build) - build components automatically using GitHub Actions.
* [actions-release](https://github.com/nuonco/actions-release) - release components automatically using GitHub Actions.

You can add these actions to your CI/CD workflows to automatically update your Nuon apps with each code change.

To automatically build a component using actions:
<CodeGroup>
```yaml build.yml
---
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Build
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        id: checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Build component
        id: build
        uses: nuonco/actions-build@v1
        with:
          api_token: ${{ secrets.nuon_api_token }}
          org: ${{ vars.nuon_org_id }}
          component_id: backend
```
</CodeGroup>


To automatically build _and_ release a component using actions:
<CodeGroup>
```yaml build-and-release.yml
---
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Build
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        id: checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Build component
        id: build
        uses: nuonco/actions-build@v1
        with:
          api_token: ${{ secrets.nuon_api_token }}
          org: ${{ vars.nuon_org_id }}
          component_id: backend

      - name: Release
        id: release
        uses: nuonco/actions-release@v1
        with:
          api_token: ${{ secrets.nuon_api_token }}
          org: ${{ vars.nuon_org_id
          build_id: ${{ steps.build.outputs.build_id }}
```
</CodeGroup>

## Supported SDKs

We now support several SDKs for working with the Nuon platform, which enable you to build Nuon directly into your
product. By integrating Nuon into your product, you can unlock self-serve and other capabilities for your customers such
as:

* customer managed installs and updates
* ability to self-serve agents
* shared responsibility deployments

While you can get started by using a turnkey installer or Terraform to manage installs, our hunch is that most products
  will integrate Nuon into their BYOC offering more officially long term.

We now support 3 official SDKs:

* [nuon-go](https://github.com/nuonco/nuon-go)
* [nuon-python](https://github.com/nuonco/nuon-python)
* [nuon-elixir](https://github.com/nuonco/nuon-elixir)

<Note>
We build both our `cli` and Terraform provider using the official `nuon-go` sdk.
</Note>

You can learn more about our [SDKs here](/sdks).

## Docs

We launched [guides](/guides) on our docs site, and have a whole lot more planned here. Today, you can use the guides
section to answer questions about the platform.

<Note>
Please share feedback on how we can improve our docs, or [let us know](mailto:team@nuon.co) if anything is missing.
