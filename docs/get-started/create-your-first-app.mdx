This guide walks you through packaging an application with the Nuon CLI into a
Nuon App Config and deploying it as an Install to an AWS cloud account. Nuon
supports Azure and soon Google Cloud, but to keep it simple, this guide focuses
on AWS.

## Choose A Sample App

Choose from the following options to get started:

- [aws-lambda](./app-aws-lambda): A Lambda function with DynamoDB and API
  Gateway
- [eks-simple](./app-aws-k8s): An AWS Kubernetes Traefik `whoami` application

<Note>
	These [App Configs](/concepts/apps) can be found in Nuon's [GitHub
	repository](https://github.com/nuonco/example-app-configs).
</Note>

## Other App Configs to Explore

For more App Config examples, clone the
[example-app-configs repository](https://github.com/nuonco/example-app-configs).
Then run the following commands:

```sh
brew install nuonco/tap/nuon
nuon login
cd example-app-configs/<app directory>
nuon apps create --name <app directory>
nuon apps sync
```

Example App Configs:

- Observability software vendor [Grafana](https://grafana.com). Read the blog post on [Installing Grafana with Nuon](https://nuon.co/blog/installing-grafana-with-nuon/)
- [httpbin](https://httpbingo.org/) on an AWS EC2 VM as a service using a Docker container
- Collaboration software vendor [Mattermost](https://mattermost.com)
- Design software vendor [Penpot](https://penpot.com)
- Cloud Development Environment software vendor [Coder](https://coder.com). Read
  the blog post on
  [Installing Coder with Nuon](https://nuon.co/blog/installing-coder-with-nuon/)

## Prerequisites

- [Set up a Nuon organization](/get-started/quickstart). You will need a working
  Nuon org.
- [Set up an AWS account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/SetUp/latest/UserGuide/setup-overview.html).
  This is the account you will create the install in.
