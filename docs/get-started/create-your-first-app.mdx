This guide walks you through packaging an application with the Nuon CLI into a
Nuon App Config and deploying it as an Install to an AWS cloud account. Nuon
supports Azure and soon Google Cloud, but to keep it simple, this guide focuses
on AWS.

## Choose A Sample App

Choose from the following options to get started:

- [aws-lambda](./app-aws-lambda): A Lambda function with DynamoDB and API
  Gateway
- [eks-simple](./app-aws-k8s): An AWS Kubernetes Traefik `whoami` application

<Note>
	These [App Configs](/concepts/apps) can be found in Nuon's [GitHub
	repository](https://github.com/nuonco/example-app-configs).
</Note>

## More Complex Apps

For more complex App Config examples that run on Kubernetes but without
step-by-step guides, clone the
[example-app-configs repository](https://github.com/nuonco/example-app-configs)
for these additional App Configs:

- Collaboration platform vendor [Mattermost](https://mattermost.com)
- Cloud Development Environment platform vendor [Coder](https://coder.com). Read
  the blog post on
  [Deploying Coder with Nuon](https://nuon.co/blog/installing-coder-with-nuon/)

## Prerequisites

- [Set up a Nuon organization](/get-started/quickstart). You will need a working
  Nuon org.
- [Set up an AWS account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/SetUp/latest/UserGuide/setup-overview.html).
  This is the account you will create the install in.
