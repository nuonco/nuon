description: "Learn how to package an app to install into AWS"
---

This guide walks you through packaging an example app 
 and install it to an AWS cloud account. Nuon supports
Azure Google Cloud, or any cloud provider but to keep it simple, this guide focuses on AWS.

<Note>
If you are new to Nuon, we recommend understanding the life cycle of packaging your app, installing your app into a cloud account, and updating, monitoring and remediating the installs by reading our [App and Install Life Cycle guide](../guides/app-install-life-cycle).
</Note>

## Choose An Example App

Choose one of the following example app guides to get started:

- [aws-lambda](./app-aws-lambda): A Lambda function with DynamoDB and API Gateway
- [eks-simple](./app-aws-k8s): An AWS EKS Traefik `whoami` application

## Other Apps to Explore

For these and other app examples, clone the
[example-app-configs repository](https://github.com/nuonco/example-app-configs).
Then run the following commands:

```sh
brew install nuonco/tap/nuon
nuon auth login
nuon orgs select
cd example-app-configs/<app directory>
nuon apps create --name <app directory>
nuon apps sync
```

## Prerequisites

- [Signup for the self-service free trial](https://app.nuon.co). You will need a login and an org in Nuon's cloud.
- [Set up an AWS account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/SetUp/latest/UserGuide/setup-overview.html).
  This is the account you will install the app in.
