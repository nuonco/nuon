This guide will walk you through setting up an organization, configuring an application, and deploying to an install. Once you've completed it, you will be ready to configure and deploy your own app.

## Install the CLI

```sh
brew install nuonco/tap/nuon
```

<Note>
If you are not using Hombrew, refer to our [CLI](/cli) documentation for other installation options.
</Note>

## Create an Account

Once you've installed the Nuon CLI, create a Nuon account by logging in.

```sh
nuon login
```

Follow the prompts in the browser and login using a Google account. Once you've logged in you can verify your API token with the `nuon orgs api-token` command. You should also now have a config file at `~/.nuon`. Values saved to this file will be used as CLI flag defaults.

## Create an Organization

Now that you're logged in you can create your first organization in sandbox mode.

<CodeGroup>
```sh create org
nuon orgs create --name {your-org-name} --sandbox-mode
```

```sh view org
nuon orgs current
```
</CodeGroup>

## Connect your GitHub Account

To deploy code from private repos you'll need to connect to your GitHub account or organization.

<CodeGroup>
```sh connect
nuon orgs connect-github
```

```sh list repos
nuon orgs list-connected-repos
```
</CodeGroup>

## Create an App

Now that you're set up, the next step is to configure and deploy an app. We have tutorials for the most popular architectures and platforms.

<CardGroup>
    {tutorials.map((tut, key) => (
        <Card key={key} title={tut.title} icon={tut.icon} href={tut.href}>
            {tut.description}
        </Card>
    ))}
</CardGroup>
