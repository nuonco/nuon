This guide will walk you through getting started with Nuon.

<Note>
You must request an organization before you can complete this guide. Please reach out to us.
</Note>

## Install the CLI

```sh
brew install nuonco/tap/nuon
```

<Note>
If you are not using Homebrew, refer to our [CLI](/cli) documentation for other installation options.
</Note>

## Authenticate

Once you have installed the Nuon CLI, log in.

```sh
nuon login
```

Follow the prompts in the browser and log in using a Google account. Once you've logged in, you can verify your API token with the `nuon orgs api-token` command. You should also now have a config file at `~/.nuon`. Values saved to this file will be used as CLI flag defaults.

## Select Your Organization

Now that you are logged in, you can select your organization to start using it.

```sh
nuon orgs select
```

Confirm you have selected the correct organization.

```sh
nuon orgs current
```

## Connect Your GitHub Account

To deploy code from private repositories, you will need to connect to your GitHub account or organization.

```sh
nuon orgs connect-github
```

Confirm the repository is connected.

```sh
nuon orgs list-connected-repos
```

## Create an App

Now that you are set up, the next step is to [configure and deploy an app](/get-started/create-your-first-app).
