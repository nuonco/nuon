Nuon is a platform you can use to build, deploy and manage BYOC apps. This page provides an overview of basic concepts essential to understanding how Nuon works.

## Organizations

In Nuon, organizations are the top-level workspace under which all operations are performed. All your apps and VCS connections are created under your org, and you grant team members access by adding them to your org.

### Org Server and Runner

When you create an org, we provisiona single-tennant server and build runner for you. The server manages the execution of builds and deploys, and is the only part of our system that has access to your source code and your customer installs.

### VCS Connections

In order to use source code from private repos for your components, you need to connect your Nuon org to your version control system. Refer to our [Connect Github guide](/guides/vcs) for more details.

## Apps

Nuon apps are versions of your application code and infrastructure that can be deployed into a customer cloud account. Refer to our [Apps configuration guide](/guides/apps) for more details.

### Components

Nuon app components are how you tell Nuon what your app consists of. We currently support:

- [Dockerfiles](/guides/docker-build-components)
- [Container Images](/guides/container-image-components)
- [Terraform](/guides/terraform-components)
- [Helm Charts](/guides/helm-chart-components)

### Sandboxes

A Sandbox defines the base infrastructure you want to use for an app's installs. It provides the base infrastructure components will run on top of, as well as a runner that manages deploys. Refer to our [Sandboxes configuration guide](/guides/sandboxes) for more details.

## Installs

An install is an instance of your app running in a customer's cloud. Refer to our [Create Installs guide](/guides/create-installs) for more details.

## Builds, Deploys, and Releases

A build packages your a component's source code into an artifact that can be deployed to customer installs. A deploy syncs a component build to a customer install, and then provisions the resources that component defines.

Releases orchestrate creating deploys, saving you the overhead of managing thousands of installs yourself. Refer to our [Creating a Release guide](/guides/create-releases) for more details.
