  configuration"

Secrets allow you to configure components with sensitive values and keys.

Secrets are defined with a `secrets.toml` and incorporated in the CloudFormation
stack. This allows users to enter values when clicking on the stack link in the
Dashboard UI, during the initial step of an install where the runner is
created as a VM. Secrets are then stored in the user's AWS Secrets Manager.

<Note>
	Because the user creates the CloudFormation stack from that Nuon-generated
	CloudFormation template using their cloud credentials, the user can enter the
	secret values at that time. Nuon will never see the secret values, as they are
	not stored in the Nuon data plane.
</Note>

Secrets can be used to configure components and actions using
[variables](/guides/using-variables).

## How do you configure a Secret?

Within your app directory, create a file named `secrets.toml`. This file will
contain the configuration for your Secrets. Alternatively, you can create a
directory named `secrets` and place individual Secret files inside it, such as
`github_app_key.toml`, `vendor_license_key`.

```toml secrets.toml
#:schema https://api.nuon.co/v1/general/config-schema?type=secrets

[[secret]]
name         = "github_app_key"
display_name = "GitHub App Key"
description  = "Base64 encoded Github App Key"
required     = true

kubernetes_sync             = true
kubernetes_secret_namespace = "control-plane"
kubernetes_secret_name      = "github-app-key"
format = "base64"

[[secret]]
name = "rds_secret"
display_name = "database password"
description = "database password"
required = true

[[secret]]
name = "vendor_license_key"
display_name = "Vendor license key"
description = "Vendor license key"
required = true

kubernetes_sync = true
kubernetes_secret_namespace = "app"
kubernetes_secret_name = "vendor-license-key"
```

Use the key-value pair `kubernetes_sync = true` to indicate that the secret
should be synced to Kubernetes as a Secret object. The
`kubernetes_secret_namespace` and `kubernetes_secret_name` fields specify where
the secret will be created in Kubernetes.

<Note>
	The `nuon secrets` command is deprecated and will be removed in a future
	release.

## Configuring Components with Secrets

Reference the secrets from AWS Secrets Manager as outputs from the
CloudFormation stack, and then use them in your component config.

```toml components/helm.toml

name              = "helm"
type              = "terraform_module"
terraform_version = "1.11.3"

[public_repo]
directory = "helm"
repo      = "your-org/your-repo"
branch    = "main"

[vars]
vendor_license_key = "{{ .nuon.install_stack.outputs.vendor_license_key_arn }}"
```

## Configuring Actions with Secrets

Reference the secrets from AWS Secrets Manager as outputs from the
CloudFormation stack, and then use them in your actions config. In this example,
the secret is assigned to an action environment variable and then referenced in
a script. Note the script is stored in the `src` directory of the app.

```toml actions/rds_secrets.toml

[[triggers]]
type           = "post-deploy-component"
component_name = "rds_cluster"

[[steps]]
name    = "Copy RDS Secret for deployment"
command = "./rds_secrets/import.sh"

[steps.env_vars]
SECRET_ARN       = "{{ .nuon.install_stack.outputs.rds_secret_arn }}"

```

```sh src/rds_secrets/import.sh

#!/usr/bin/env bash
secret_arn="$SECRET_ARN"

echo "[rds-secrets import] reading db access secrets from AWS"
secret=`aws --region $region secretsmanager get-secret-value --secret-id=$secret_arn`

```

## Changing Secrets Outside of the App

If you need to change a secret value outside of the app, e.g., in AWS Secrets
Manager and use manual means to apply the Secret to your infrastructure,
understand that Nuon will not detect the change. In order for Nuon to be aware
of the change, you will have to either reprovision the Install or review the
Dependency Graph in the Dashboard UI and manually reinstall the components or
actions that depend on the secret.
