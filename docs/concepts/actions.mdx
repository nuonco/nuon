Actions allow you to create automated workflows that can be run in Installs. Actions are useful for debugging, running scripts, and implementing health checks.

## What are Actions?

Actions are reusable workflows that can be configured to run on your Installs. Each Action consists of:

* A trigger that determines when the action runs
* One or more steps that define what the action does

Actions can be used for:

* Running database migrations
* Executing maintenance scripts
* Collecting diagnostic information
* Automating operational tasks
* Running custom health checks

## How do you configure an Action?

Create an `actions` directory at the root of the App Config, and create a TOML file for each action. e.g., `alb_healthcheck.toml` `deployment_restart.toml` `kubectl_logs.toml`.

If Actions need to connect to a VCS, use either a public repo (using a `public_repo` block) or a private GitHub
repo (using a `connected_repo` block). Read more about VCS configuration [here](/guides/vcs).

For example, to pull logs from all Kubernetes pods in a namespace, you would write an action like this:

<CodeGroup>
```toml actions/kubectl_logs.toml
#:schema https://api.nuon.co/v1/general/config-schema?type=action
name    = "kubectl_logs"
timeout = "30s"

[[triggers]]
type = "manual"

[[steps]]
name = "kubectl logs"
inline_contents = """
#!/usr/bin/env sh
kubectl logs -n $NAMESPACE --all-containers=true -l app.kubernetes.io/name=ctl-api-api
"""

[steps.env_vars]
NAMESPACE = "default"
```
</CodeGroup>


For example, if you wanted to implement a healthcheck for an AWS ALB, you would write something like this:

<CodeGroup>
```toml actions/http_healthcheck.toml
#:schema https://api.nuon.co/v1/general/config-schema?type=action

name    = "http_healthcheck"
timeout = "0m15s"

[[triggers]]
type          = "cron"
cron_schedule = "*/5 * * * *"

[[triggers]]
type = "manual"

[[steps]]
name    = "healthcheck"
command = "./healthcheck"

[steps.public_repo]
repo      = "nuonco/actions"
branch    = "main"
directory = "common"

[steps.env_vars]
ENDPOINT             = "https://your-app.{{.nuon.install.sandbox.outputs.public_domain.name}}"
METHOD               = "HEAD"
EXPECTED_STATUS_CODE = "200"
```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>We maintain a [collection of commonly-used actions](https://github.com/nuonco/actions) in an open-source repo for you to get started with.</Note>

## Running Actions

Actions can be triggered in several ways:

* Manually via the Dashboard or CLI
* On a schedule
* In response to events

To run an action manually:

```sh
nuon actions create-run -w <action-workflow-id> -i <install-id>
```

## Action Triggers

Action Triggers are documented in the [Changelog 009](https://docs.nuon.co/updates/009-action-triggers-secrets-configs#action-triggers).

## Action History

You can view the history of action runs using the CLI:

```sh
nuon actions list-runs -w <action-workflow-id> -i <install-id>
```

Or get details about a specific run:

```sh
nuon actions get-run -r <run-id> -i <install-id>
```

## Action Permissions

Actions are run with the same permissions as the [Runner](/concepts/runners) in each install.
