Nuon supports several different component types that allow you to connect your existing DevOps automation, 
infrastructure as code, and containers to your app.

## What is a Component?

A component represents a part of your application. Nuon supports the following component types:

* [Docker](/guides/docker-build-components) - Any Dockerfile that can be built
* [Container Images](/guides/container-image-components) - Any prebuilt OCI image
* [Helm Charts](/guides/helm-chart-components) - Any Helm chart located in a repository
* [Terraform](/guides/terraform-components) - Any Terraform module

Setting up an application requires defining and testing your application configuration.

## Component Management

The [CLI](/cli) exposes many operational commands to manage components.

To see all available commands, run: `nuon components --help`.

<Note>
Make sure to select an app using `nuon apps select` before using the components commands, or pass the `-a` flag to each 
component command.
</Note>

### Pinning a Component

You can pin a component, which will set its ID as a default argument to all component commands. This is helpful to avoid 
having to pass `-c` to each command.

<CodeGroup>
```sh nuon
nuon components select
```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
Each example below assumes you have run `nuon components select` first.
</Note>

To show the currently pinned component:

<CodeGroup>
```sh nuon
nuon components current
```
</CodeGroup>

### Component Management Commands

Commands for working with components:

<Note>
Components can only be created using the Terraform provider or configuration file.
</Note>

**Get a component**
<CodeGroup>
```sh nuon
nuon components get 
```
</CodeGroup>

**List components** - List components for an app.

<CodeGroup>
```sh nuon
nuon components list
```
</CodeGroup>

**Delete a component** - Delete a component.

<Note>
It is not recommended to delete components using the CLI. Instead, manage them using Terraform or config files.
</Note>

<CodeGroup>
```sh nuon
nuon components delete -c component_id
```
</CodeGroup>

**Print a component config** - Print the latest configuration for a component.

<CodeGroup>
```sh nuon
nuon components latest-config
```
</CodeGroup>

### Component Builds

All components must be built before releasing. The release commands support an `-auto-build` flag which will trigger a 
build.

**Create a build** - Create a build using the latest component configuration.

<CodeGroup>
```sh nuon
nuon builds create -c component_id
```
</CodeGroup>

**List builds** - List builds for a component.

<CodeGroup>
```sh nuon
nuon builds list
```
</CodeGroup>

**Get a build** - Print out build details.

<CodeGroup>
```sh nuon
nuon builds get -b <build-id>
```
</CodeGroup>

**Logs** - Show logs for a build.

<CodeGroup>
```sh nuon
nuon builds logs -b <build-id>
```
</CodeGroup>

**Print Plan** - Print a build plan with configuration for the build.

<CodeGroup>
```sh nuon
nuon builds print-plan -b <build-id>
```
</CodeGroup>
