Nuon supports several different Component types that allow you to connect your
existing container images, Helm charts, Kubernetes Manifests and Terraform code
to your app.

## What is a Component?

A Component represents a part of your App. Nuon supports the following Component
types:

- [Helm Charts](/guides/helm-chart-components) - Any Helm chart located in a
  repository
- [Terraform](/guides/terraform-components) - Any Terraform module
- [Kubernetes Manifest](/guides/kubernetes-manifest-components) - Any raw
  kubernetes manifest
- [Docker](/guides/docker-build-components) - Any Dockerfile that can be built
- [Container Images](/guides/container-image-components) - Any prebuilt OCI
  image

## How do you configure a Component?

A Component is configured in an individual `<component name>.toml` file inside a
directory called `components` in the root of your app directory. e.g., a Helm
chart Component named `grafana` would be defined in a file named `grafana.toml`
inside a directory named `components`.

Additional Component configuration files can be added to the `components`
directory or another directory in the app directory, and referenced in the
Component's config file. e.g., you can have a `values.yaml` file for a Helm
chart Component to deploy observability platform from Grafana Labs located in
`components/values/grafana`

You can configure Components to use either a public repo (using a `public_repo`
block) or a private GitHub repo (using a `connected_repo` block). Read more
about VCS configuration [here](/guides/vcs).

<CodeGroup>
```toml components/grafana.toml
#:schema https://api.nuon.co/v1/general/config-schema?type=helm
name           = "grafana"
type           = "helm_chart"
chart_name     = "grafana"
namespace      = "grafana"
storage_driver = "configmap"
dependencies   = ["prometheus"]

[public_repo] repo = "grafana/helm-charts" directory = "charts/grafana" branch =
"main"

[[values_file]] contents = "./values/grafana/values.yaml"

````
</CodeGroup>

By default, every Component must have a `git` repository to store its source files, but you can include them in the app directory and reference the same app repo in the Component TOML file. This example shows a Component that uses the same repo as the app to store its AWS Terraform module to create the certificate in AWS:

<CodeGroup>
```toml components/certificate.toml
[public_repo]
repo      = "nuonco/example-app-configs"
directory = "grafana/src/components/certificate"
branch    = "main"
````

</CodeGroup>

## Component Management

The [CLI](/cli) exposes many operational commands to manage components.

To see all available commands, run: `nuon components --help`.

<Note>
	Make sure to select an App using `nuon apps select` before using the `nuon
	components` commands, or pass the `-a` flag to each `nuon component` command.
</Note>

### Component Management Commands

<Note>
	There no longer is a `nuon components select` command to pin a Component.
	Instead, pass the `-c` flag to each command to specify the Component by its ID
	or name.
</Note>

Commands for working with Components:

<Note>Components can only be created using a configuration file.</Note>

**List Components** - List Components for an App.

<CodeGroup>```sh nuon nuon components list ```</CodeGroup>

**Get a Component**

<CodeGroup>
```sh nuon
nuon components get -c <component_id or component_name>
```
</CodeGroup>

**Delete a Component** - Delete a Component.

<Note>
	It is not recommended to delete Components using the CLI. Instead, manage them
	using config files.
</Note>

<CodeGroup>```sh nuon nuon components delete -c component_id ```</CodeGroup>

**Print a Component config** - Print the latest configuration for a Component.

<CodeGroup>
```sh nuon
nuon components latest-config -c <component_id or component_name>
```
</CodeGroup>

### Component Builds

All Components must be built before releasing. Syncing an app for the first time
or if a Component configuration has changed will also trigger a Build. The
release commands support an `-auto-build` flag which will trigger a Build.

**Create a Build** - Create a Build using the latest Component configuration.

<CodeGroup>```sh nuon nuon builds create -c component_id ```</CodeGroup>

**List Builds** - List Builds for a Component.

<CodeGroup>
```sh nuon
nuon builds list -c <component_id or component_name>
```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
	If you do not pass the `-c` flag, all Builds for all Components in the
	currently selected App will be listed.
</Note>

**Get a Build** - Print out Build details.

<CodeGroup>
```sh nuon
nuon builds get -b <build-id> -c <component_id or component_name>
```
</CodeGroup>

**Logs** - Show logs for a Build by opening the Dashboard.

<CodeGroup>
```sh nuon
nuon builds logs -b <build-id> -c <component_id or component_name>
```
</CodeGroup>
