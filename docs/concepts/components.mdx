Nuon supports several different component types which allow you to connect your existing devops automation, 
infrastructure as code and containers to your app.

## What is a Component?

A component represents a part of your application, Nuon supports the following components:

* [Docker](/guides/docker-build-components) - any Dockerfile that can be built.
* [Container Images](/guides/container-image-components) - any prebuilt OCI image.
* [Helm Charts](/guides/helm-chart-components) - any Helm chart located in a repository.
* [Terraform](/guides/terraform-components) - any Terraform module.
* [Jobs](/guides/job-components) - any script that can be executed using an OCI image.

Setting up an application requires definining and testing your application configuration.

## Component Management

The [cli](/cli) exposes many operational commands to manage components.

To see all available commands, run: `nuon components --help`.

<Note>
Make sure to select an app using `nuon apps select` before using the components commands, or pass the `-a` flag to each 
component command.
</Note>

### Pinning a Component

You can pin a component, which will set it's ID as a default argument to all component commands. This is helpful to avoid 
having to pass `-c` to each command.

<CodeGroup>
```sh nuon
nuon components select
``
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
Each example below assumes you have run `nuon components select` first.
</Note>
