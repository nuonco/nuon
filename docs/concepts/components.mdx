Nuon supports several different Component types that allow you to connect your existing DevOps automation, 
infrastructure as code, and containers to your app.

## What is a Component?

A Component represents a part of your App. Nuon supports the following Component types:

* [Docker](/guides/docker-build-components) - Any Dockerfile that can be built
* [Container Images](/guides/container-image-components) - Any prebuilt OCI image
* [Helm Charts](/guides/helm-chart-components) - Any Helm chart located in a repository
* [Terraform](/guides/terraform-components) - Any Terraform module
* [Kubernetes Manifest](/guides/kubernetes-manifest-components) - Any raw kubernetes manifest

## How do you configure a Component?

A Component is configured in an individual `<component name>.toml` file inside a directory called `components` in the root of your App Config directory. e.g., a Helm chart Component named `whoami` would be defined in a file named `whoami.toml` inside a directory named `components`.

Alternatively, you can nest individual Component files inside directories inside the `components` directory. For example, you could have a directory named `infra` inside the `components` directory, and define an S3 Bucket Component named `buckets.toml`.

Additional Component configuration files can be added to the `components` directory or another directory in the App Config directory like `src`, and referenced in the Component's config file. e.g., you can have a `values.yaml` file for a Helm chart Component located the root of the `components` directory.

You can configure Components to use either a public repo (using a `public_repo` block) or a private GitHub
repo (using a `connected_repo` block). Read more about VCS configuration [here](/guides/vcs).

<CodeGroup>
```toml components/whoami.toml
#:schema https://api.nuon.co/v1/general/config-schema?type=helm
name           = "whoami"
type           = "helm_chart"
chart_name     = "whoami"
namespace      = "whoami"
storage_driver = "configmap"

[public_repo]
repo      = "nuonco/demo"
directory = "eks-simple/src/components/whoami"
branch    = "main"

[[values_file]]
contents = "./values/whoami.yaml"
```
</CodeGroup>

By default, every Component must have a `git` repository to store its source files, but you can include them in the App Config directory and reference the same App Config repo in the Component TOML file. e.g., a Terraform Component named `lamdba` that uses a `variables.tf` file and Python code can be located in the App Config directory's `src` directory and referenced as the Public Repo in the Component's config file:

<CodeGroup>
```toml components/lamdba.toml
[public_repo]
repo      = "acme-co/my-app"
directory = "src/components/lamdba"
branch    = "main"
```
</CodeGroup>


## Component Management

The [CLI](/cli) exposes many operational commands to manage components.

To see all available commands, run: `nuon components --help`.

<Note>
Make sure to select an App using `nuon apps select` before using the `nuon components` commands, or pass the `-a` flag to each 
`nuon component` command.
</Note>

### Pinning a Component

You can pin a Component, which will set its ID as a default argument to all `nuon component` commands. This is helpful to avoid 
having to pass `-c` to each command.

<CodeGroup>
```sh nuon
nuon components select
```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
Each example below assumes you have run `nuon components select` first.
</Note>

To show the currently pinned Component:

<CodeGroup>
```sh nuon
nuon components current
```
</CodeGroup>

### Component Management Commands

Commands for working with Components:

<Note>
Components can only be created using a configuration file.
</Note>

**Get a Component**
<CodeGroup>
```sh nuon
nuon components get 
```
</CodeGroup>

**List Components** - List Components for an App.

<CodeGroup>
```sh nuon
nuon components list
```
</CodeGroup>

**Delete a Component** - Delete a Component.

<Note>
It is not recommended to delete Components using the CLI. Instead, manage them using config files.
</Note>

<CodeGroup>
```sh nuon
nuon components delete -c component_id
```
</CodeGroup>

**Print a Component config** - Print the latest configuration for a Component.

<CodeGroup>
```sh nuon
nuon components latest-config
```
</CodeGroup>

### Component Builds

All Components must be built before releasing. The release commands support an `-auto-build` flag which will trigger a 
Build.

**Create a Build** - Create a Build using the latest Component configuration.

<CodeGroup>
```sh nuon
nuon builds create -c component_id
```
</CodeGroup>

**List Builds** - List Builds for a Component.

<CodeGroup>
```sh nuon
nuon builds list
```
</CodeGroup>

**Get a Build** - Print out Build details.

<CodeGroup>
```sh nuon
nuon builds get -b <build-id>
```
</CodeGroup>

**Logs** - Show logs for a Build.

<CodeGroup>
```sh nuon
nuon builds logs -b <build-id>
```
</CodeGroup>

**Print Plan** - Print a Build plan with configuration for the Build.

<CodeGroup>
```sh nuon
nuon builds print-plan -b <build-id>
```
</CodeGroup>
