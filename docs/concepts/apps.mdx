Nuon apps are versions of your application code and infrastructure that can be deployed into a customer cloud account. Please refer to the [Terraform
reference](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/nuonco/nuon/latest/docs/resources/app) for full configuration
options.

<Note>
Nuon is designed to lift and shift your existing application and infrastructure code, so you can quickly create one or more B.Y.O.C. deployable versions of your product.

In most cases, setting up your app should only take an afternoon.
</Note>

## What Is An App?

When you first set up Nuon, you will map your existing product into one or more apps. A Nuon app is a fully configured version of your product that can be installed into your customer's cloud account.

Each Nuon app consists of the following parts:

* `sandbox` - The base infrastructure layer
* `runner` - The Nuon service that manages the install
* `inputs` - Customer-provided input values
* `components` - Your application and infrastructure

Nuon is designed so you can lift and shift your _existing_ application and infrastructure into new deployment options. Most Nuon users will create multiple apps to offer different "flavors" of B.Y.O.C. to their customers.

## App Sandbox

The app sandbox is the base layer of each app and is responsible for setting up any shared infrastructure to configure an install. In most cases, sandboxes consist of the following resources:

* Basic cloud account access and controls (such as IAM on AWS)
* Basic network infrastructure (such as an AWS VPC)
* Compute infrastructure (such as a Kubernetes or ECS cluster)

Read more about sandbox configuration [here](/concepts/sandboxes).

## App Inputs

App inputs allow you to define different inputs that customers can provide. This enables you to create "configuration" knobs that your customers can manage to control your application.

App inputs are commonly used to:

* Allow users to select regions and provide access to an account
* Customize infrastructure versions, such as pinning a Kubernetes cluster version
* Re-use existing infrastructure, such as providing a `vpc_id` that has been granted access

Read more about app inputs [here](/concepts/app-inputs).

## App Components

App components are used to connect your existing application and infrastructure code to your Nuon app.

Components allow you to:
* Import existing images, or build Dockerfiles and sync these artifacts into customer accounts
* Deploy Helm charts
* Deploy Terraform code

Nuon apps allow you to create dependencies between components and expose a rich configuration language to share outputs
between components for configuration. You can use [variables](/guides/using-variables) to configure components with
the outputs of other components.

## App READMEs

When running an App in an Install, you often need to document important info. It can also be nice to have some level of programmability, such being able to render a button that will trigger an Action. Additionally, this documentation must be rendered per-Install because certain values -- such as URLs -- will be different for each Install.

App READMEs were introduced to support this. Each App has a `readme` text field where you can define a Markdown document which will be rendered in the Dashboard for each Install of that App. You can use all valid Markdown, including HTML. You can also use variables, so that the document will be custom-rendered for each Install.

See the [Using READMEs](guides/using-readmes) guide for more details.

## App Management

The [CLI](/cli) exposes many operational commands to manage apps.

To see all available commands, run: `nuon apps --help`.

### Pinning an App

You can pin an app, which will set its ID as a default argument to all app commands. This is helpful to avoid 
having to pass `-a` to each command.

<CodeGroup>
```sh nuon
nuon apps select
```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
Each example below assumes you have run `nuon apps select` first.
</Note>

To show the currently pinned app:

<CodeGroup>
```sh nuon
nuon apps current
```
</CodeGroup>

### App Management Commands

Commands for creating, deleting, and viewing apps.

**Create an app** - Create an app and kickstart a [config file](/configuration-files).

<CodeGroup>
```sh nuon
nuon apps create  \
  --name=your-app
```
</CodeGroup>

**Get an app** - Get an app

<CodeGroup>
```sh nuon
nuon apps get
```
</CodeGroup>

**List all apps** - List all apps

<CodeGroup>
```sh nuon
nuon apps list
```
</CodeGroup>

**Rename** - Rename an app

<CodeGroup>
```sh nuon
nuon apps rename --name=new-name
```
</CodeGroup>

### Configuration

You can view various configs for an app and sync configuration files using the [CLI](/cli).

**Sync** - Sync config files

Sync all config files in the current directory:
<CodeGroup>
```sh nuon
nuon apps sync
```
</CodeGroup>

Sync a single config file:
<CodeGroup>
```sh nuon
nuon apps sync -c <path-to-config.toml>
```
</CodeGroup>

**Configs** - List all config versions for an app

<CodeGroup>
```sh nuon
nuon apps configs
```
</CodeGroup>

**Export-terraform** - Export the current application configuration as Terraform JSON

<CodeGroup>
```sh nuon
nuon apps export-terraform
```
</CodeGroup>

**Runner-config** - Print the current runner config

<CodeGroup>
```sh nuon
nuon apps runner-config
```
</CodeGroup>

**Sandbox-config** - Print the current sandbox config

<CodeGroup>
```sh nuon
nuon apps sandbox-config
```
</CodeGroup>

**Input-config** - Print the current input config

<CodeGroup>
```sh nuon
nuon apps input-config
```
</CodeGroup>

## App Metadata

You can add the following metadata to your application, which is used in installers:

* `display_name`
* `description`

This metadata can be added via a config file or Terraform:

```toml nuon.<your-app>.toml
display_name = "Your App"
description = "your app"
```
