## What is an Install?

When an install is created, a [runner](/concepts/runners) is initially created
as a VM in the customer's cloud and is responsible for deploying the sandbox,
components, and actions in your app in the correct order defined in the app
Config.

## Install Lifecycle

When an Install is created, the following are provisioned:

- [Runner](/concepts/runners) - the Nuon-managed Runner as a VM that manages the
  install.
- [Sandbox](/concepts/sandboxes) - the base infrastructure for networking and
  compute. e.g., Kubernetes cluster
- [Components](/concepts/components) - the parts of your app. e.g., Helm charts,
  Kubernetes manifests, certificates, load balancers
- [Actions](/concepts/actions) - any operational tasks as shell scripts that can
  be run in the install. e.g., health check

When an install is deleted, each component will be deleted in reverse order,
according to its [dependencies](/guides/component-dependencies), and then the
sandbox is destroyed. The runner is then deleted by deleting the configuration
that was used to create it. e.g., deleting the AWS CloudFormation stack.

## Install Management

The primary and recommended way to create and manage installs is through the
Dashboard UI. The Dashboard outputs the AWS CloudFormation stack link to share with
the customer to create the runner VM and kick off the install process.

Beginning an install involves entering one or more inputs in a modal form of the Dashboard UI.

![Inputs](../images/concepts/inputs/inputs.png)

Following the inputs submission, the install process begins as a [workflow](./workflows) of steps
that can be monitored, approved, and re-tried in the Dashboard UI.

### Changing Components

If you change a component in an app that already has installs, you need to
re-deploy the Component to the install in the Dashboard. A modal will prompt you
to select the Build you want to use, which usually is the first one in the list
sorted by build date in descending order.

### Use the Dashboard UI

The [Dashboard UI](../dashboard-ui) provides a full interface to create,
view, update, de-provision and delete installs.


### Using the CLI

The [cli](/cli) exposes many operational commands to manage an install.

To see all available commands, run: `nuon installs --help`.

### Pinning an Install

You can pin an install, which will set it's ID as a default argument to all
install commands. This is helpful to avoid having to pass `-i` to each command.

```sh
nuon installs select
```

<Note>
	Each example below assumes you have run `nuon installs select` first.
</Note>

To show the currently pinned install:

```sh
nuon installs current
```

### Install Management Commands

Commands for creating, deleting and viewing installs.

**Create an Install** - create an install for an AWS application, passing in one
or more Inputs.

```sh
nuon installs create \
    --name=install \
    --region=us-east-1 \
	--role=iam-role
```


**List all Installs** - list an install

```sh
nuon installs list
```

**Get an Install** - get an install

```sh
nuon installs get
```

**Delete an Install** - Delete an install

```sh
nuon installs delete
```

### Install Config Commands

Manage installs with the help of
[Install Config files](/configuration-files#install-config).

**Sync** - syncs installs defined in config files to Nuon. Existing installs are
updated, otherwise a new install gets created for the app.


```sh
nuon installs sync -a <app-name-or-id> -d <path-to-file-or-dir>
```


**Generate Config** - easily generate an Install config file for an existing
Install.


```sh
nuon installs generate-config -i <install-name-or-id>
```


The following is an an example install config file:


```toml
name = "config_demo"
approval_option = "approve-all"

[aws_account]
region = "us-east-1"

[inputs]
sub_domain = "whoami"
app_release = "v2.25.0"
````


### Install Sandbox Commands

Commands for working with an install's sandbox.

**Show Sandbox updates** - show all updates to an install's sandbox.


```sh
nuon installs sandbox-runs
````



**Show Sandbox run logs** - show logs for a specific sandbox run.


```sh
nuon installs sandbox-run-logs -r <run-id>
```


**Reprovision a Sandbox** - reprovision the sandbox with the latest configured
Sandbox version for an App.

```sh
nuon installs reprovision
```

**Deprovision a sandbox** - Deprovision a sandbox.

```sh
nuon installs deprovision
```

### Install Components

Each component is deployed to an install when it is first created. When a
component is created after an install has been provisioned, it will
automatically be deployed to it upon the first release.

The Nuon CLI provides the following commands to manage install components:

<Note>
	Each example here assumes you have run `nuon installs select` first.
</Note>

**Show Deploys** - show deploys for an install.

```sh
nuon installs list-deploys
```

**Deploy Logs** - print logs for a deploy.


```sh
nuon installs deploy-logs -d <deploy-id>
```


**Deploy Plan** - print a deploy plan for an install.


```sh
nuon installs print-deploy-plan -d <deploy-id>
```
