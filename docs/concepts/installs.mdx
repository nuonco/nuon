## What is an Install?

When an Install is created, a [Runner](/concepts/runners) is initially created as a VM in the customer's cloud and is responsible for 
deploying the Sandbox, Components, and Actions in your App in the correct order defined in the App Config. 

## Install Lifecycle

When an Install is created, the following Components are provisioned:

* [Runner](/concepts/runners) - the Nuon managed Runner that manages the Install.
* [Sandbox](/concepts/sandboxes) - the base infrastructure for networking and compute. 
* [Components](/concepts/components) - the parts of your App.
* [Actions](/concepts/actions) - any operational tasks that can be run in the Install.

When an Install is deleted, each Component will be deleted in reverse order, according to its 
[dependencies](/guides/component-dependencies), and then the Sandbox is destroyed. The Runner is then deleted by deleting the configuration that was used to create it. e.g., deleting the AWS CloudFormation stack.

## Install Management

The primary and recommended way to create and manage Installs is through the Dashboard. The Dashboard outputs the AWS CloudFormation stack link to create the Runner and kick off the Install process.

The [cli](/cli) exposes many operational commands to manage an Install.

To see all available commands, run: `nuon installs --help`.

### Pinning an Install

You can pin an Install, which will set it's ID as a default argument to all Install commands. This is helpful to avoid 
having to pass `-i` to each command.

<CodeGroup>
```sh nuon
nuon installs select
```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
Each example below assumes you have run `nuon installs select` first.
</Note>

To show the currently pinned Install:

<CodeGroup>
```sh nuon
nuon installs current
```
</CodeGroup>

### Install Management Commands

Commands for creating, deleting and viewing Installs.

**Create an Install** - create an Install for an AWS application, passing in one or more Inputs.

<Note>
Creating Azure Installs is currently only supported using an installer, or our API.
</Note>

<CodeGroup>
```sh nuon
nuon installs create  \
  --name=install \
  --region=us-east-1 \
  --role=iam-role
```
</CodeGroup>

**Delete an Install** - Delete an Install

<CodeGroup>
```sh nuon
nuon installs delete 
```
</CodeGroup>

**List all Installs** - list an Install

<CodeGroup>
```sh nuon
nuon installs list
```
</CodeGroup>

**Get an Install** - get an Install

<CodeGroup>
```sh nuon
nuon installs get
```
</CodeGroup>

### Install Config Commands

Manage Installs with the help of [Install Config files](/configuration-files#install-config).

**Sync** - syncs Installs defined in config files to Nuon. Existing installs are updated, otherwise a new install gets created for the app.

<CodeGroup>
```sh nuon
nuon installs sync -a <app-name-or-id> -d <path-to-file-or-dir>
```
</CodeGroup>

**Generate Config** - easily generate an Install config file for an existing Install.

<CodeGroup>
```sh nuon
nuon installs generate-config -i <install-name-or-id>
```
</CodeGroup>

### Install Sandbox Commands

Commands for working with an Install's Sandbox.

**Show Sandbox updates** - show all updates to an Install's Sandbox.

<CodeGroup>
```sh nuon
nuon installs sandbox-runs
```
</CodeGroup>

**Show Sandbox run logs** - show logs for a specific Sandbox run.

<CodeGroup>
```sh nuon
nuon installs sandbox-run-logs -r <run-id>
```
</CodeGroup>

**Reprovision a Sandbox** - reprovision the Sandbox with the latest configured Sandbox version for an App.

<CodeGroup>
```sh nuon
nuon installs reprovision
```
</CodeGroup>

**Deprovision a Sandbox** - Deprovision a Sandbox.

<CodeGroup>
```sh nuon
nuon installs deprovision
```
</CodeGroup>

### Install Components

Each Component is deployed to an Install when it is first created. When a Component is created after an Install has been 
provisioned, it will automatically be deployed to it upon the first release.

The Nuon CLI provides the following commands to manage install Components:

<Note>
Each example here assumes you have run `nuon installs select` first.
</Note>

**Show Deploys** - show deploys for an Install.

<CodeGroup>
```sh nuon
nuon installs list-deploys
```
</CodeGroup>


**Deploy Logs** - print logs for a deploy.

<CodeGroup>
```sh nuon
nuon installs deploy-logs -d <deploy-id>
```
</CodeGroup>

**Deploy Plan** - print a deploy plan for an install.

<CodeGroup>
```sh nuon
nuon installs print-deploy-plan -d <deploy-id>
```
</CodeGroup>
