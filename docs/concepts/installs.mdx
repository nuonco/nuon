Installs are instances of an application in a customer cloud account.

## What is an Install?

An install is an instance of an application running in a customer cloud account. When an install is created, each 
component in your application will be deployed in the correct order, alongside a runner which is responsible for 
managing the software.

## Install Lifecycle

When an install is created, the following components are provisioned:

* [sandbox](/concepts/sandboxes) - the base infrastructure for networking and compute. 
* [runner](/concepts/runners) - the Nuon managed runner that manages the install.
* [components](/concepts/components) - the parts of your application.

When an install is deleted, each component will be deleted in reverse order, according to its 
[dependencies](/guides/component-dependencies), and then the runner and sandbox are destroyed.

## Install Management

The [cli](/cli) exposes many operational commands to manage an install.

To see all available commands, run: `nuon installs --help`.

### Pinning an Install

You can pin an install, which will set it's ID as a default argument to all install commands. This is helpful to avoid 
having to pass `-i` to each command.

<CodeGroup>
```sh nuon
nuon installs select
```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
Each example below assumes you have run `nuon installs select` first.
</Note>

### Install Management Commands

Commands for creating, deleting and viewing installs.

**Create an install** - create an install for an AWS application, passing in one or more inputs.

<Note>
Creating Azure installs is currently only supported using an installer, or our API.
</Note>

<CodeGroup>
```sh nuon
nuon installs create  \
  --name=install \
  --region=us-east-1 \
  --role=iam-role \
  --inputs=eks_version=1.28
```
</CodeGroup>

**Delete an install** - delete an install

<CodeGroup>
```sh nuon
nuon installs delete 
```
</CodeGroup>

**List all installs** - list an install

<CodeGroup>
```sh nuon
nuon installs list
```
</CodeGroup>

**Get an install** - get an install

<CodeGroup>
```sh nuon
nuon installs get
```
</CodeGroup>

### Install Sandbox Commands

Commands for working with an install's sandbox.

**Show sandbox updates** - show all updates to an install sandbox.

<CodeGroup>
```sh nuon
nuon installs sandbox-runs
```
</CodeGroup>

**Show sandbox run logs** - show logs for a specific sandbox run.

<CodeGroup>
```sh nuon
nuon installs sandbox-run-logs -r <run-id>
```
</CodeGroup>

**Reprovision a sandbox** - reprovision the sandbox with the latest configured sandbox version for an app.

<CodeGroup>
```sh nuon
nuon installs reprovision
``
</CodeGroup>

**Deprovision a sandbox** - deprovision a sandbox.

<CodeGroup>
```sh nuon
nuon installs deprovision
```
</CodeGroup>

### Install Components

Each component is deployed to an install when it is first created. When a component is created after an install has been 
provisioned, it will automatically be deployed to it upon the first release.

The Nuon CLI provides the following commands to manage install components:

<Note>
Each example here assumes you have run `nuon installs select` first.
</Note>

**Show Deploys** - show deploys for an install.

<CodeGroup>
```sh nuon
nuon installs list-deploys
```
</CodeGroup>


**Deploy Logs** - print logs for a deploy.

<CodeGroup>
```sh nuon
nuon installs deploy-logs -d <deploy-id>
```
</CodeGroup>

**Deploy Plan** - print a deploy plan for an install.

<CodeGroup>
```sh nuon
nuon installs print-deploy-plan -d <deploy-id>
```
</CodeGroup>


## Deploying to a specific install

While iterating on your application's configuration it can be helpful to deploy to a single install, you can do this by 
  creating a release and targeting a single install id.

<CodeGroup>
```sh nuon
nuon releases create -i <install-id> -c <component>
```
</CodeGroup>
