App Variables are values that you can store in the API to be used across all installs of an app.

## Defining App Variables

You can create App Variables using the CLI.

```sh
nuon apps variables create --name=external_api_key --value=b25yYW5nZXRpZ2h0bHlhdHRlbXB0cGxlbnR5cmVhZGRvdWJsZXdlc3RleWVodW50d2g=
```

Once created you should be able to view the default using the CLI.

```sh
nuon apps variables list
```

If you no longer need the default, you can delete it using the CLI

```
nuon variables delete --id=apsmsj5rucsdc758c2cs6x7geu
```

## Using App Variables

App Variables are included in the install state, and are available in job plans. Using our example secret named `external_api_key`, you could interpolate it's value in your app config using `{{ .nuon.app.variables.external_api_key }}`.

<Note>
If you add or a update an app default after an install has been created. You will need to update that install's state before the value will be included in plans. Running a deploy or sandbox provision will trigger a state update.
