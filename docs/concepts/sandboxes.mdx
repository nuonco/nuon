## What is a Sandbox?

Sandboxes create a consistent, isolated environment that your application can be
guaranteed to work with, across your App Installs different installs. They are
responsible for defining the basic networking, permissioning, and infrastructure
compute primitives e.g., a Kubernetes cluster - to power the App.

In a shared responsiblity model, a customer may provide some infrastructure in
the Sandbox, such as an existing VPC or Kubernetes cluster. In this case,
Sandboxes enable you to leverage this customer infrastructure to meet security
requirements, while also having a consistent way to deploy and manage your App
in any account.

Sandboxes can ensure isolation, reproducability and repeatability with each
install - regardless of the account.

## How is a Sandbox configured?

A Sandbox is configured in a `sandbox.toml` file inside the root of your App
Config directory. To configure a Sandbox, specify a repo and the correct
parameters for your Sandbox.

Inputs and variables, are entered both inline in the `sandbox.toml` and also the
`tfvars` file - to configure the Sandbox, and these are passed to the Terraform
code that is run by the Sandbox.

You can configure Sandboxes to use either a public repo (using a `public_repo`
block) such as Nuon's public repository of AWS and Azure sandboxes - or a
private GitHub repo (using a `connected_repo` block). Read more about VCS
configuration [here](/guides/vcs).

```toml sandbox.toml
#:schema https://api.nuon.co/v1/general/config-schema?type=sandbox
terraform_version = "1.11.3"

[public_repo]
directory = "."
repo      = "nuonco/aws-eks-sandbox"
branch    = "main"

[vars]
cluster_version = "1.33"
cluster_name    = "n-{{.nuon.install.id}}"

enable_nuon_dns      = "true"
public_root_domain   = "{{ .nuon.inputs.inputs.root_domain }}"
internal_root_domain = "internal.{{ .nuon.inputs.inputs.root_domain }}"

[[var_file]]
contents = "./sandbox.tfvars"
```

```toml sandbox.tfvars
additional_namespaces = ["grafana"]

min_size = 2
max_size = 3
desired_capacity = 2
```

## Nuon Managed Sandboxes

We maintain managed Sandboxes for each [platform](/concepts/platforms) that we
support. Each platform has a turnkey sandbox (where all resources are
provisioned). These sandboxes are designed to be a stable, configurable starting
point and most relevant options around the network, cluster and compute are
configurable.

<Note>
	[Let us know](https://nuon.co/contact-us) if you have a use case for bringing
	your own VPC or Kubernetes cluster, and we can show how to adjust the sandbox
	configuration.
</Note>

We publish each Sandbox as a GitHub repository and you can find detailed
documentation for each Sandbox there. These repositories are what you will
reference in your `sandbox.toml`.

[AWS EKS Sandbox](https://github.com/nuonco/aws-eks-sandbox)

[AWS EKS with Karpenter Sandbox](https://github.com/nuonco/aws-eks-karpenter-sandbox)

[AWS Min Sandbox](https://github.com/nuonco/aws-min-sandbox)

[Azure AKS Sandbox](https://github.com/nuonco/azure-aks-sandbox)

<Note>
	The AWS Min Sandbox does not create a Kubernetes cluster, but still provisions
	a Route 53 Zone and IAM roles for the install. See the [Lambda function
	example](../get-started/app-aws-lambda) that leverages the AWS Min Sandbox.
</Note>

## Runner Types

Update the `runner.toml` in your App Config to specify the type of Cloud runner
to use for your App. The runner is responsible for executing the deployment of
your App into the customer's account.

```toml runner.toml
#:schema https://api.nuon.co/v1/general/config-schema?type=runner

runner_type = "aws"
helm_driver = "configmap"
```

```toml runner.toml
#:schema https://api.nuon.co/v1/general/config-schema?type=runner

runner_type = "azure"
helm_driver = "configmap"
```

## Sandbox Outputs

Sandbox outputs are made accessible to all components
[using variables](/guides/using-variables).

You can use any output from your selected Sandbox by setting a config value on
your component. In this example, we are using the `account.region` output from
the Sandbox to configure a Helm chart component:

```toml components/e2e_helm.toml
name   = "e2e_helm"
type = "helm_chart"
chart_name = "e2e-helm"

[public_repo]
repo      = "org/repo"
directory = "chart"
branch    = "main"

[values]
account_region = "{{.nuon.install.sandbox.outputs.account.region}}"
```

See the
[outputs.tf](https://github.com/nuonco/aws-eks-sandbox/blob/main/outputs.tf) for
the AWS EKS Sandbox for a full list of available outputs or the
[outputs.tf](https://github.com/nuonco/aws-min-sandbox/blob/main/outputs.tf) for
the AWS Min Sandbox. 

Example outputs include:
* `account.id` - The AWS Account ID
* `account.region` - The AWS Region
* `vpc.id` - The VPC ID
* `cluster.cluster_name` - The EKS Cluster name
* `cluster.cluster_endpoint` - The EKS Cluster endpoint
* `ecr.repository_url` - The ECR repository URL
* `ecr.registry_url` - The ECR registry URL
* `nuon_dns.public_domain` - The public root domain for the install
* `nuon_dns.internal_domain` - The internal root domain for the install
* `namespaces` - A list of namespaces created in the cluster

## Configure Sandboxes

Each Sandbox has a set of variable inputs. Most variables are either
supplied by the Nuon platform during install, via Inputs, or by setting default
values.

### Use Default Values

To configure a Sandbox parameter with a default value for your App, add a `vars`
block to your `sandbox.toml` file, or the mandatory `sandbox.tfvars` file in the
same directory as your `sandbox.toml`. The values in this block will be used as
defaults for all installs of this App.:

```toml sandbox.toml
[vars]
cluster_name         = "n-{{.nuon.install.id}}"
enable_nuon_dns      = "true"
public_root_domain   = "{{ .nuon.install.id }}.nuon.run"
internal_root_domain = "internal.{{ .nuon.install.id }}.nuon.run"

[[var_file]]
contents = "./sandbox.tfvars"
```

```toml sandbox.tfvars
additional_namespaces = ["grafana"]

min_size = 2
max_size = 3
desired_capacity = 2
```

### Use Inputs

Inputs allow you to collect customer input in the dashboard at App Install for
values such as resource IDs, tokens and more. These Inputs are accesible to all
Components and your Sandbox, [using variables](/guides/using-variables#inputs).

To configure a Sandbox parameter using an Input, you can define an Input in your
`inputs.toml` file and then reference it in your `sandbox.toml` file. In this
example, we define a root domain Input and use it to set the
`public_root_domain` variable in the Sandbox:

```toml inputs.toml
[[group]]
name         = "dns"
description  = "DNS Configrations"
display_name = "Configurations for the root domain for Route53"

[[input]]
name         = "root_domain"
description  = "The root domain. Services will be made available at subdomains of this root domain."
default      = "app.example.com"
display_name = "Root Domain"
group        = "dns"
```

```toml sandbox.toml
[vars]
public_root_domain   = "{{ .nuon.inputs.inputs.root_domain }}"
```

## Create a Custom Sandbox

While our [open source Sandboxes](#nuon-managed-sandboxes) are a great starting
point, you can always fork them, or create your own Sandbox to support
customizing.

To use a custom Sandbox, simply update your App Config's `sandbox.toml` to point
to your new Sandbox code. Custom Sandboxes can also use private GitHub repos,
that are connected to Nuon.

```toml sandbox.toml
#:schema https://api.nuon.co/v1/general/config-schema?type=sandbox
terraform_version = "1.11.3"

[public_repo]
repo = "your-org/private-repo"
directory = "sandbox"
branch = "main"
```

<Note>
If one of our managed Sandboxes does not work for you, and you are considering creating a custom Sandbox, we would love to hear about your use case. Please [get in touch](https://nuon.co/contact-us).
