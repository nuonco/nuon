You'll need an access token to use the Nuon API. You can get an access token by logging in via the Nuon [dashboard][1] or the Nuon CLI.

To get your access token via the Nuon CLI, first login

```sh
nuon login
```

then view the API token

```sh
nuon orgs api-token
```

## Using the API Reference

You can call the Nuon API endpoints from the API Reference by adding `Bearer <your-api-token>` to the "Authorization" field in each endpoint card. Verify you're API token with the [current-user](/api-ref/general/get-current-user) endpoint.
