## Input Types

You can now define an input type, which denotes which type of input is accepted. This is used to control rendering 
across different install inputs, and will allow us to build more semantic meaning into inputs.

You can define a `type` field on an input in your config. The following types are supported:

* `string`
* `bool`
* `number`
* `json`
* `list`

Input types are currently only settable as metadata, but will be rolled out to all different surfaces of install 
management soon.

<Note>This change is backwards compatible and all current inputs will default to `string` as their `type`.</Note>

## Internal Inputs

Internal inputs are inputs that are only settable via the Nuon dashboard. This allows you to define inputs that a 
customer can not control directly, or set internal values.

You can use `internal: true` to mark an input as internal.

<Note>This change is backwards compatible and all current inputs will default to `internal: false`.</Note>

## Dependencies

## Improvements To Deletes

## Fixes

* Input Group and Input ordering is now respected.
