## Install Config Files

You can now manage installs via source control for apps managed by `nuon apps sync`. Create one config file per-install
in a folder named `installs/` under your app's config. Now syncing the app will also create/update the corresponding
installs. For more details take a look at [Install Config file reference](/configuration-files#install-config).

```toml
name = "config_demo"
approval_option = "approve-all"

[aws_account]
  region = "us-east-1"

[inputs]
  sub_domain = "whoami"
  test = "required-value"
  testdefault = "default-value"
```

## Generate an Install Config File

To make it even easier to manage existing installs using CI, we have added a new command `nuon installs generate-config` to
import an existing install and generate a config file for it. After this generated config file is placed in the `installs` folder
of your app's config, it can be tweaked to make updates to the install.

## Workflow Step Groups

Workflow steps are now grouped, and some retries will retry an entire group when required. For instance, when retrying a 
Terraform apply step, the plan can not be reused, so a new group is created and the plan is retried (and re-approved) 
first.
