1. `docker_build`
1. `terraform_module`
1. `helm_deploy`

If two components have the same dependencies _and_ the same type, they will be ordered by name. For instance, in the 
  following deploy, only the helm deploy has any defined dependencies:

on the install component page.

In rare cases, it can be helpful to forgo tearing down install components and deprovision only the sandbox. You can do 
this using the UI:
