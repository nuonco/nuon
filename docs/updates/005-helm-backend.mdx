_May 12th, 2025_

<div className="badge badge--primary">v0.19.550</div>


## Custom Helm Driver
You can now store helm release information in Nuon API. 
You can customise it by editing the `helm_driver` value in `runner.toml` file of the app.

```toml
runner_type = "aws"
helm_driver = "nuon"
```

## Helm Driver Options
* `secret`- Store helm release information in kubernetes secrets. This is the default driver.
* `configmap`- Store helm release information in kubernetes configmaps.
* `nuon`- Store helm release information in Nuon API.

<Note>
This feature is currently in alpha and experimental.

## `nuon dev` CLI Command

<Warning>
This feature is currently in alpha and experimental. 
</Warning>

We have added a new CLI command, `nuon dev`, that you can use to create a new app version and deploy it to a dev install.
To use it:

1. Open a nuon app config directory.
1. Create a dev branch.
1. Run `nuon installs select` to select the install you want to develop with.
1. Make some changes and push them to your remote.
1. Run `nuon dev` and follow the prompts.

A new app version will be created and deployed to your dev install.
This new version will __only__ be deployed to your dev install.
Other installs will not be affected.

Additionally, you can pass the flag `--yes` to auto-approve all prompts. Make sure you have the correct branch and install set up before you do this.

<Note>
If you update only the source code of a component, and not it's config, a new build will not be created.
You must create a build for that component yourself.
This shortcoming will be resolved in a future update of this feature.
