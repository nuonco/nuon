## Management Mode

With this new release, were introducing a new method to manage install runner's which we've dubbed "runner management
mode." Management mode is a standalone runner process that runs on the install runner VM and is responsible for
monitoring and managing the health of the VM as well as a child runner process. This allows us an additional degree of
flexibility for managing updates and paves the way for future runner features. This release introduces runner management
mode into GA as an opt-in feature which can be enabled by configuring the `init_script_url` attribute in `runner.toml`
in the app config.

```toml
#:schema https://api.nuon.co/v1/general/config-schema?source=runner
runner_type     = "aws"
helm_driver     = "configmap"
init_script_url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nuonco/runner/refs/heads/main/scripts/aws/init-mng.sh"
```

## Sensitive Inputs and Install Config Files

Write one to two sentences describing what your changes were and how the person reading would use them. If you have
them, be sure to add a screenshot and/or code block that accompanies your changes with a visual.

## App Variables

Sometimes you need to use the same value across all installs of an app. While you can do this using the default value of
an App Input, this is not an ideal solution. These values are typically irrelevant to your customer, and you do not want
to display them during the install process. There is also no way to prevent them from being overriden.

To solve this problem we have introduced App Variables, a simple key/value store you can reference from app configs. The
values are not managed in the app config itself, and therefore do not need to be stored in version control, and are not
displayed to your customer during the install process.

You can create app variables via the CLI.

```sh
nuon apps variables create --name=my_var --value="some value"
```

To use an app variable, interpolate in your app config.

```toml actions/demo_action.toml
#:schema https://api.nuon.co/v1/general/config-schema?source=action

name    = "simple_demonstration"
timeout = "1m"

[[triggers]]
type = "manual"

[[steps]]
name    = "show the value of my_var"
inline_contents = """
#!/usr/bin/env sh

echo $MY_VAR
"""
[steps.env_vars]
MY_VAR="{{.nuon.app.variables.my_var}}"
```

Learn more about App Variables in [the docs](concepts/app-variables).

## Orderable Action Triggers

It is often useful to be able to determine an explicit order for actions. We're introducing a new optional field `index`
o action triggers that allows you to define an order for actions with the same trigger. For example, you can define a
trigger like this in one action:

```toml
# post_cert_deploy_action_1.toml
[[triggers]]
type           = "post-component-deploy"
component_name = "certificate"
index          = 1
```

and in another action:

```toml
# post_cert_deploy_action_2.toml
[[triggers]]
type           = "post-component-deploy"
component_name = "certificate"
index          = 2
```

This will result in the actions running in the order defined by `index`.
