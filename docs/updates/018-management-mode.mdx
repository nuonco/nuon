## Management Mode

Management mode is a standalone runner process that runs on the install runner VM and is responsible for
monitoring and managing the health of the VM as well as the runner process itself. Read more about how to enable this for
your installs here: [Runner Management Mode](/guides/runner-management-mode).

## Stack Config Breaking Change

We fixed a bug where the `runner_nested_template_url` is now recognized, where as before it was ignored.

<Warning>
This requires a config update for any apps that currently define a `runner_nested_template_url` in their `stack.toml`, as older versions of the nested template could be invalid or not work.
</Warning>

We recommend using the latest nested template url: 

```toml
runner_nested_template_url = "https://nuon-artifacts.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/aws-cloudformation-templates/v0.1.6/runner/asg/stack.yaml"
```

## Sensitive Inputs and Install Config Files

When you generate a config, inputs will now be grouped together, reflecting the input groups you have defined in the app
config. Senstive inputs will be excluded, to avoid saving them in plain text in version control.

```toml
name = "my_install"

[aws_account]
  region = "us-east-1"

[[inputs]]
  use_insecure_cookies = "false"

[[inputs]]
  bool_type = "true"
  json_type = "{\"key\": \"value\"}"
  number_type = "10"
```

When syncing install config files, sensitive inputs will be ignored. They can still be managed manually via the
Dashboard.

## App Variables

App Variables is a feature that allows you to define values you can use across all installs of an app. The
values are not managed in the app config itself, and therefore do not need to be stored in version control, and are not
displayed to your customer during the install process.

You can create app variables via the CLI.

```sh
nuon apps variables create --name=my_var --value="some value"
```

To use an app variable, interpolate them in your app config.

```toml actions/demo_action.toml
#:schema https://api.nuon.co/v1/general/config-schema?source=action

name    = "simple_demonstration"
timeout = "1m"

[[triggers]]
type = "manual"

[[steps]]
name    = "show the value of my_var"
inline_contents = """
#!/usr/bin/env sh

echo $MY_VAR
"""
[steps.env_vars]
MY_VAR="{{.nuon.app.variables.my_var}}"
```

## Orderable Action Triggers

It is often useful to be able to define an explicit order for actions. We are introducing a new optional field ,`index`,
on action triggers that allows you to define an order for actions with the same trigger. For example, you can define a
trigger like this in one action:

```toml
# post_cert_deploy_action_1.toml
[[triggers]]
type           = "post-component-deploy"
component_name = "certificate"
index          = 1
```

and in another action:

```toml
# post_cert_deploy_action_2.toml
[[triggers]]
type           = "post-component-deploy"
component_name = "certificate"
index          = 2
```

This will result in the actions running in the order defined by `index`.

## Bug Fixes

- Nested Runner ASG Cloudformation Stack is now respected and used during install stack re/provisions.
- Fixed a bug causing workflow cancellation to intermittently fail.
