Refer to our roadmap to learn more about the larger, foundational features we are building. For most smaller and 
iterative features based on customer feedback, we generally ship within a week.

Please share your feedback on our roadmap and <a href="mailto:team@nuon.co">let us know</a> if you would like us to consider something not listed below.

## Typescript SDK

_June 2024_

We are building a Typescript SDK that will allow anyone to use our API directly from their own application.

## Runner V2

_June 2024_

We are building a new runner, that will serve as the foundation of our day-2 operations, and replace our existing 
runner. We are designing this runner to be more secure, faster and operationally simplified.

This will allow us to build more custom day-2 operations tooling into the product.

## Programmable Runner Diagnostics and OTEL

_July 2024_

We are building a custom diagnostics and scripting runtime on top of the runner. This will allow our customers to:

1. Use template scripts, or write custom scripts to query logs, metrics and other observability data.
1. Write custom diagnostic scripts that can be used to monitor your application.
1. Run operational scripts such as `terraform`, `helm` and others.

This will serve as the foundation for our day-2 tooling that allows you to integrate your existing stack and build more 
visibility into your customer installs.

## CLI V2

_July 2024_

We are shipping a redesigned CLI that will be extendable, easier to use and designed to interactively onboard.

## GCP Support

_July 2024_

We are adding GCP support in early July, and will create a first class experience for kubernetes/non-kubernetes apps on 
GCP.

## Template Apps

_August 2024_

We will be adding a more PAAS (platform as a service) like experience which will allow anyone with a `Dockerfile` to 
create a BYOC offering of their application.

## Integrations into your stack 

_August 2024_

Our new runner, and programmable diagnostics will allow us to collect richer observability and health data on your 
installs. From there, you will be able to integrate this data into your own stack and tools with everything from webhook 
notifications, to forwarding of metrics and logs.

Currently, we support [notifications](/guides/notifications) to get slack notifications for some install and app events.
