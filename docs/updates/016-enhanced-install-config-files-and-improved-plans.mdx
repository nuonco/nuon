## New Installs Sync CLI Command

Syncing installs is now independent from app config syncing. The new "installs sync" command can
be used with a single [Install config file](/configuration-files#install-config) or with a directory
containing multiple install config files.

```bash
nuon installs sync -a <app-name-or-id> -d <path-to-file-or-dir>
```

## Forget Install CLI Command

The "forget install" command is now available in our CLI client, bringing feature parity with the Dashboard UI. This gives developers more flexibility in managing their installs directly from the command line.

```bash
nuon installs forget -i inlcz0349isibg7pyw1f5p8zf5 --confirm
```

## Improved Plans

Added inline YAML diff support to Helm plan UI so Helm plan changes now display with inline YAML diffs for better visibility.

## State Management Improvements

We've refactored our install state generation and fetching to deliver better performance across the platform. This optimization reduces loading times for Dashboard views that rely on state data and improves memory efficiency in our temporal background processes.

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed CLI nuon installs deploy-components command.
- Fixed missing stack outputs from state.
- Fixed teardown of Docker build images not working.
- Upgraded AWS EKS sandbox AWS provider version.
- Improved error display for "build is not deployable".
