## Install Config file improvements

**Toggle Install Config file syncing from UI** We have added an Install Config sync toggle in the management menu. 
Users can now enable/disable Install Config syncing from the dashboard UI itself.

**Required Inputs** Install Config files now need to have the required inputs defined explicitly. Now it is not 
possible to set thier value from UI, or utilising the default value implicitly.

## Bug Fixes

- UI: Fixed missing badge for Install managed by config file in the header.
- CLI: Fix empty diff when syncing a new install using a config file.
- CLI: Syncing an Install without having Install Config syncing enabled now results in an error. These only produced a warning before, going unnoticed in CI workflows.
