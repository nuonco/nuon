## Install Config file improvements

### Toggle Install Config file syncing

Users can now enable or disable syncing an Install from a config file, from dashboard UI as well as CLI.

**Dashboard UI** You can find the toggle to enable/disable config file syncing in the management menu of an Install.

**CLI** The CLI features a new command to toggle config file syncing for an Install. Run `nuon installs toggle-sync` to toggle the config file syncing, or use `--enable` or `--disable` to explicitly set the syncing status.

### Required Inputs

Install Config files now need to have the required inputs defined explicitly. Now it is not 
possible to set their value from UI, or utilising the default value implicitly.

## Bug Fixes

- UI: Fixed missing badge for Install managed by config file in the header.
- CLI: Fix empty diff when syncing a new install using a config file.
- CLI: Syncing an Install without having Install Config syncing enabled now results in an error. These only produced a warning before, going unnoticed in CI workflows.
