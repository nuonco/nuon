## Install Inputs

Install input parameters can now be integrated into your CloudFormation stack, allowing users to add them when installing
your application. You can now also distinguish between vendor-provided inputs and user-configurable inputs, with vendor
as the default source type.

## Sign-Up Updates

Support users are now added to trial orgs, to provide support for new users.

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed issue with steps ordering during teardown processes.
- Removed empty input groups from CloudFormation templates.
- Improved resilience to state issues caused by cookies.
- Fixed rendering of break glass roles on install actions page.
- Install will be put into "mangaed-by-config" mode, even if there are no changes to sync.
- Install configs will generate even if inputs are empty.
