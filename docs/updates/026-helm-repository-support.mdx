## Helm Repository Support

Helm Components now support deploying charts directly from public Helm repositories via the `helm_repo` block. This allows you to use any chart available on public repositories like the Prometheus Community charts without needing to maintain your own Git repository.

To use a public Helm chart, specify the repository URL and chart name:

```toml
[helm_repo]
repo_url = "https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts"
chart    = "kube-prometheus-stack"
```

This is equivalent to the Helm CLI workflow:
```bash
helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
helm install my-release prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack
```

You can discover public Helm charts on [Artifact Hub](https://artifacthub.io/), which indexes thousands of open-source Helm charts.

See the [Helm Chart Components](/guides/helm-chart-components#using-public-helm-repositories) guide for more details.
