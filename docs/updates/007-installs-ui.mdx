## Installs Web UI

We're excited to share that Nuon has introduced the first version of our installs management web UI. This feature provides a detailed list of all your installs, including each install's settings, status, and history. Furthermore, it enables you to monitor the status and configuration of every part of your application on these installs, along with the sandbox and deployment history.
