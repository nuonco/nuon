March 15th, 2024

We shipped a whole new way to manage your Nuon application and installs.

## Installs Web UI

This dashboard provides a detailed list of all your installs, including each install's settings, status, and history. Furthermore, it 
enables you to monitor the status and configuration of every part of your application on these installs, along with the 
sandbox and deployment history.
