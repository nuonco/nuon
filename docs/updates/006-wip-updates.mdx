## Improved Secrets

The secrets have had their naming convention updated to better support multiple deployments into the same account and
faciliate access to these names which are guaranteed to be unique. The new naming convention is:

```txt
{{.nuon.install.id}}/{{.secret.name}}
```

Additionally, the secret ARN is now included in the `secrets` objects in `{{.nuon.secrets}}`.
