## Secret Formats

Some complex secrets have formatting that can cause problems when being added to a CloudFormation stack. To enforce that 
a secret is base64 encoded, you can add the `format: base64` field to a secret.

The following secret will be expected as a base64 encoded secret when inserted into the stack.
```toml
[[secret]]
name         = "github_app_key"
display_name = "GitHub App Key"
description  = "Github App Key for BYOC Nuon Install {{.nuon.id}}"
required     = true

kubernetes_sync             = true
kubernetes_secret_namespace = "ctl-api"
kubernetes_secret_name      = "github-app-key"
format = "base64"
```

The runner sync job will automatically decode the value based on the format when syncing into the Kubernetes secret.
