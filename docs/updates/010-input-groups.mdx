## Input Groups

You can now split up inputs into groups, allowing you to create step-based onboarding flows.

To create an input group:

```toml
[[group]]
name = "sandbox"
description = "Sandbox inputs"
display_name = "Sandbox inputs"

[[group]]
name = "default"
description = "Default inputs"
display_name = "Default Inputs"
```

Each input must declare a group that it belongs too:

```toml
[[input]]
name = "api_key"
description = "API key"
default = ""
sensitive = true
display_name = "API Key"
group = "default"
```

The self-hosted installers will automatically render each group.

## App Secrets

You can now add app secrets, which can be used to set sensitive values during configuration.

To add a secret:

```bash
$ nuon secrets create --name=secret --value=secret-value
```

Now, to reference a secret in your configuration:

```toml
[connected_repo]
directory = "deployment"
repo = "nuon/demos"
branch = "main"

[[value]]
value = "{{.nuon.app.secrets.secret}}"
```

## Installer Themes

We have updated the installer to use a tailwind theme for most styles.

To set your theme, simply export or create a Tailwind them and add it into your installer, under `theme.ts`.

You can learn more about self-hosted installers [here](/concepts/installers).
