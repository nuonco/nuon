## Approvals

You can now see a Helm or Terraform plan when updating an install. Each workflow will automatically prompt you to 
approve the plan, and only proceed upon approval.

## Auto Approve Install

You can auto approve all changes on an install.

## Auto Approve Workflow

Sometimes, you just want to approve the first step in a workflow. You can approve all following steps on a workflow, 
which means each step will automatically proceed.

## Re Plan

When an approval has been waiting for an extended period of time, you can re-run the plan phase by pressing the 
**Retry Plan** button.

This will re-run the plan step, and prompt the approval before continuing.
