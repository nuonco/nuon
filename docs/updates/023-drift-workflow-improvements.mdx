## Drift Scanning Enhancements

We've expanded our drift detection capabilities with new scanning features.

**Component Drift Scanning**: You can now trigger drift scans directly from individual component
pages to detect configuration drift at the component level.

**Sandbox Drift Scanning**: Added drift scan functionality for sandbox environments, allowing you
to identify discrepancies between expected and actual sandbox states.

**Break Glass Action Info**: Added comprehensive break glass information to action pages, giving
  you better visibility into emergency access procedures and their usage.

## Bug Fixes and Improvements

- **Log Streams**: Fixed issue resulting in log streams not being closed properly.
- **Component Configuration**: Resolved issues with TOML parsing and component capability handling.
- **Action Validation**: Resolved action run validation errors that were preventing successful action execution.
- **Monitoring**: Added frontend endpoint timing metrics for better observability.
