April 15th, 2024

It turns out we were onto something with our [installer](/concepts/installers) idea, and you all kept coming up with 
more and more awesome ideas on how you could embed them in your product.

## Open Source Installer

We recently open sourced our installer UI. You can now fork, deploy and customize it to build 
your own installation experience.

Under the hood, the installer is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) app with [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) wired up.

You can fork the installer in our repo [here](https://github.com/nuonco/installer).

<Note>We are actively working with each customer running an installer, and upstreaming whatever functionality we can. 
Let us know all your ideas!</Note>

## Multi App Installers

Previously, installers only supported a single application, which meant you could end up with several different 
installer links to share with customers. Since most customers support at least 2 application configurations and some 
support up to 6, this was already becoming a problem.

You can configure multiple apps in your config file, by adding the appIDs you want attached to the installer:

```bash nuon
$ nuon apps list
```

```toml
name = "your installer"
apps = [
    "appx16i8wxxqjvzadc25lf56cz",
    "appn8f101b3ei5vcfpmdewdtwb",
]
```

## Prefilled Form Fields

You can prefill form fields in your installer, by passing values via a query string. This allows you to create "magic 
links" in your own signup flow, and inject things like API keys, regions and more.

Any field that is declared as an input can be auto filled by adding the `?input_name=value` query parameter. For 
example, if you have an input named `api_key`, you can pass in an API key via the link using: 
`https://your-installer?api_key=<value>`.

## Helm Components Support Values Files

You can add custom Helm values file to an a [Helm Component](/guides/helm-chart-components) using our config file:

```toml
[[values_file]]
source = "./charts/prod.values.yaml"

[[values_file]]
source = "./charts/byoc-overrides.values.yaml"
```

This allows you to re-use your existing values files.
