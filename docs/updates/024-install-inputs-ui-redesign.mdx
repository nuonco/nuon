## Install Inputs via Install Stack

We've introduced a powerful new way to manage install inputs through install stacks, providing better consistency and easier configuration management:

- **Stack-Level Input Management**: Install inputs can now be defined and managed at the install stack level, allowing for better reusability and consistency across multiple installs.
- **Vendor vs User Input Sources**: New input source type system distinguishes between vendor-provided inputs and user-configurable inputs, with vendor as the default source type.
- **Enhanced Input Filtering**: Install forms now intelligently filter and display only vendor inputs, improving the configuration experience.
- **Input Groups**: CLI now uses input groups instead of flat inputs in install config files for better organization.
- **CloudFormation Integration**: Install input parameters are properly integrated into AWS stack outputs and CloudFormation templates.

## Stratus UI Redesign

We've rolled out a comprehensive UI redesign (codenamed "Stratus") across the dashboard with modern components and improved user experience:

- **New Component Library**: Complete redesign with modern, consistent UI components moved into the new Stratus design system.
- **Enhanced Navigation**: Cleaned up navigation structure with improved sidebar organization and right-click context menu support in the navbar.
- **Install Management**: New install components management interface with enhanced component dependency graphs and change tracking.
- **Version Visibility**: Added version information to the Stratus sidebar for better release tracking.
- **Tables & Status Views**: Redesigned tables with improved install status displays and better data presentation.
- **Action Triggers**: New install actions trigger interface with advanced filtering capabilities.
- **Events Page**: Updated events page with improved event tracking and visualization.
- **404 Page**: Added custom 404 page with better user experience.
- **Halloween Theme**: Special bat swarm loading animation (seasonal feature).

## Workflow & Temporal Improvements

- **Consistent Workflow IDs**: Temporal workflow IDs are now consistent for install workflows, improving traceability and debugging.
- **Workflow Name Templates**: Updated name templates for generate steps child workflows for better consistency.
- **Temporal Link Filtering**: Enhanced temporal link filters for install workflows, making it easier to find and debug specific workflow executions.
- **Workflow Retry**: Re-enabled continuing temporal workflows for installs with improved reliability.
- **Component Build Retry**: Disabled retry on component build not found errors to prevent unnecessary retry loops.
- **Endpoint Registration**: Fixed retry endpoint registration issues that were affecting workflow reliability.

## Developer Experience

- **Cache Control**: Fixed cache control headers to allow proper building of Helm dependencies.

## Performance & Infrastructure

- **Service-Level Locking**: Moved locking mechanism to service level for better performance and reduced contention.
- **ClickHouse Optimizations**:
  - Disabled all CH system query log tables to improve performance
  - Set TTL to 3 days for processors_profile_log
  - Fixed TTL configuration on profiler table
- **Slow Query Fixes**: Resolved slow table queries and metrics event write errors.
- **Parallel Dockerfile Operations**: Moved operations to parallel execution in Dockerfile for faster builds.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Enhanced slow query metrics and error tracking.

## Security & Access Control

- **Support Role Duration**: Set maximum duration for support role access for better security.
- **Break Glass Rendering**: Fixed rendering of break glass roles on install actions page.

## API & Documentation

- **Endpoint Renaming**: Second pass on endpoint renaming for better API consistency (disabled version check for renamed endpoints).
- **Gin Groups**: Implemented Gin routing groups for better API organization.
- **Approval Response Updates**: Updated approval response structure for better clarity.
- **Workflow Concept Docs**: Added comprehensive workflows concept documentation.
- **Lifecycle Documentation**: Enhanced lifecycle and reference documentation in starter guides.
- **API Validation**: Improved validation error messages for better developer experience.

## Bug Fixes

- **Navigation Issues**: Fixed various navigation and routing issues in the dashboard.
- **Input Source Methods**: Corrected method names to reflect new enum values for app input source types.
- **Empty Input Groups**: Removed empty input groups from CloudFormation templates.
- **Teardown Step Ordering**: Fixed issue with steps ordering during teardown processes.
- **Workdir Handling**: Resolved workdir handling issues in runner execution.
- **Config Schema**: Fixed config schema 5xx errors.
- **Action Filter**: Removed problematic isOpen state from action filter.
- **Seed App Inputs**: Added proper user inputs for seed applications.
- **Transaction Cookie**: Removed `__txn` cookie middleware and disabled prefetch on Next.js links to prevent state issues.

## Infrastructure Updates

- **Deployment Configuration**: Reduced endpoint tags due to temporal requirements and updated deployment naming.

## UI/UX Improvements

- **Install Status Display**: Enhanced install status indicators throughout the interface.
- **User Journey**: Clear user journey on seed to improve onboarding experience.
- **Event Updates**: Improved event display and tracking across the platform.

This release represents a major milestone with the introduction of install inputs via stack, a complete UI redesign with the Stratus component library, and significant performance improvements across the platform.
