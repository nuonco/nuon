## Apps Rename

You can now rename an application using our CLI.

First, pin an app:

```bash
$ nuon apps select
```

Next, run the `apps rename` command:

```bash
$ nuon apps rename --name=<new-app-name>
```

## App Notifications

You can setup a slack channel to receive notifications about your application, and get notified of new installs and 
more.

Simply generate a channel webhook URL, and add it into your app config:

```toml
slack_webhook_url = <your-url>
````

To learn more about setting up a channel, please refer to our [guide](/guides/notifications).

<Note>We are planning on adding support for webhook notifications. If you would like this, please <a 
href="mailto:team@nuon.co">get in touch</a></Note>.

## App Metadata

You can now declare a `display_name` and `description` on your app, which will then be rendered in your installer.

```toml
version = "v1"
description = "App configuration for bring-your-own-network."
display_name = "Bring your own network"
```

This is helpful for controlling the description of each app, and explaining the differences between configuration 
options.

## Foundational Improvements

As always, what we are sharing here is not all that meets the eye. We've been hard at work productionizing our support 
and Nat + Jon have been working on some foundational work for our new runner (namely, better authorization in our API 
and some foundational UI tooling and testing).
