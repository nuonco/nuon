## At a glance

Nuon offers two primary methods for configuring and managing your app: the Nuon CLI and the Nuon Terraform provider or the Nuon API. This guide will concentrate on the former, as it is the quickest way to begin using Nuon.

In this quickstart guide, we will first install the Nuon CLI and Terraform providers. Next, we'll create an account and optionally link it to GitHub. After that, we'll configure your app, create installs using Terraform, and finally, release your app.

## Installing the CLI and Terraform provider
TKTK

## Create your account
```sh
nuon login
```

## Create an org

```sh
nuon orgs create --name --sandbox-mode
```

### (Optional) Connect a GitHub account
```sh
nuon orgs connect-github
```

## Configure your app using Terraform
tktk

### Creating your app
<CodeGroup>

```hcl outputs.tf
output "example" {
  value = module.example
}
```

```hcl inputs.tf
variable "example" {
  type        = string
  description = "example tf file"
}
```

```hcl data.tf
data "example" "current" {}
```

```hcl variables.tf
variable "example" {
  type        = string
  description = "example tf file"
}
```

</CodeGroup>

### Creating installs of your app

<CodeGroup>

```sh nuon cli
nuon installs create -n quickstart -r us-east-1 -o {aws-iam-role} --inputs eks_version=lastest
```

```hcl variables.tf
variable "install_id" {
  type        = string
  description = "install_id"
}

variable "region" {
  type        = string
  description = "region"
}

variable "public_domain" {
  type        = string
  description = "the root domain for the install. Usually {{.nuon.install.public_domain}}"
}

variable "public_domain_zone_id" {
  type        = string
  description = "the zone id for the public domain for the install"
}
```

</CodeGroup>

### TKTK Plan/Apply

## Releasing your app
tktk

### Create a build
```sh
nuon builds create -c {component-name || component-id}
```

### Create a release
```sh
nuon releases create -c {component-name || component-id}
```

### Example

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion icon="message-bot" title="Install our Github app">
  Our Github app automatically deploys your changes to your docs site, so you
  don't need to manage deployments yourself. You can find the link to install on
  your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com). Once the bot has been
  successfully installed, there should be a check mark next to the commit hash
  of the repo.
</Accordion>
<Accordion icon="rocket" title="Push your changes">
  [Commit and push your changes to
  Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository#about-git-push)
  for your changes to update in your docs site. If you push and don't see that
  the Github app successfully deployed your changes, you can also manually
  update your docs through our [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).
