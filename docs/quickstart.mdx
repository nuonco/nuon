## At a Glance

Nuon provides two primary methods for configuring and managing your app: the Nuon CLI and the Nuon Terraform provider or the Nuon API. This guide will focus on the former, as it is the quickest way to start using Nuon.

In this quickstart guide, we will first install the Nuon CLI and Terraform providers. Next, we'll create an account and optionally link it to GitHub. After that, we'll configure your app, create installs using Terraform, and finally, release your app.

## Installing the CLI and Terraform Provider

You can install our CLI with the following command:
```sh
$ echo "y" | /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://nuon-artifacts.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cli/install.sh)"
```

You can run `nuon version` to verify it's been installed.

## Forking the Quickstart Repository

Ultimately, this guide will have you releasing an example application in our [quickstart repository][1], so we suggest forking the [quickstart repository][1].

## Create Your Account

Once you've installed the Nuon CLI, we'll want to create a Nuon account by logging in.

```sh
nuon login
```

Follow the prompts in the browser and login using a Google account. _We plan to support other identity providers in the near future._

Once you've logged in you can verify you're Nuon token with the `nuon orgs api-token` command. If you're logged in you should see you're Nuon access token.

## Create an org
Now that you're logged in you can create your first Org. We'll create this Org in `--sandbox-mode`, which means we won't actually be creating cloud resources in the background. The purpose of sandbox mode is to allow you to test your app configuration without needing to wait on actual cloud resources. 

```sh
nuon orgs create --name {your-org-name} --sandbox-mode
```

You can view the new Org using the `nuon orgs current` command.

### (Optional) Connect a GitHub account
While connecting a GitHub account isn't necessary you will more than likely be deploying applications from your source code. You can limit the connection to a single repository ([quickstart fork][#forking-the-quickstart-repo]) and can disconnect from within your GitHub settings whenever you'd like.

```sh
nuon orgs connect-github
```

When you've completed the connection flow you should be able to list your connected repos using the `nuon orgs list-connected-repos` command.

## Configure your app using Terraform


### Creating your app
<CodeGroup>

```hcl outputs.tf
output "example" {
  value = module.example
}
```

```hcl inputs.tf
variable "example" {
  type        = string
  description = "example tf file"
}
```

```hcl data.tf
data "example" "current" {}
```

```hcl variables.tf
variable "example" {
  type        = string
  description = "example tf file"
}
```

</CodeGroup>

### Configuring your app's components

### Creating installs of your app

<CodeGroup>

```sh nuon cli
nuon installs create -n quickstart -r us-east-1 -o {aws-iam-role} --inputs eks_version=lastest
```

```hcl variables.tf
variable "install_id" {
  type        = string
  description = "install_id"
}

variable "region" {
  type        = string
  description = "region"
}

variable "public_domain" {
  type        = string
  description = "the root domain for the install. Usually {{.nuon.install.public_domain}}"
}

variable "public_domain_zone_id" {
  type        = string
  description = "the zone id for the public domain for the install"
}
```

</CodeGroup>

### Plan/Apply

## Releasing your app

Now that you've configured your app and have some installs created we can release your app. To do this we have two steps to complete, first we will build the app components then deploy the artifacts to the installs.

### Create a build
```sh
nuon builds create -c {component-name || component-id}
```

### Create a release
```sh
nuon releases create -c {component-name || component-id}
```
