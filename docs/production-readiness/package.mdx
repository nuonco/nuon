You package an App for Nuon by creating an [App](/concepts/apps). This is where
you will define what environment the app needs, what components it consists of,
and how it will be configured during deployment.

## Inputs

[Inputs](/concepts/app-inputs) are how your [App](/concepts/apps) will be
configured during deployment.

### Integrating with the Customer Environment

Because the customer will be hosting your app in their environment, you may want
to include security and cost management options. A few example of options you
might include are:

- Integrate with their own auth provider, such as Auth0.
- Configure what VPC to deploy in for security reasons.
- Configure what size VM instance to use, to manage cost.

### Grouping

To keep things managable, we recommend grouping inputs by domain. For example:

- App Preferences: admin user, admin password, and other app settings
- VPC Configuration: VPC ID, Private Subnet ID, Public Subnet ID
- Hosting Options: Instance Type, Use Auto-Scaling

### Secrets

If your customer needs to configure passwords, private tokens, or other
sensitive values, define an input as a [Secret](/concepts/app-secrets). Secret
values are saved to the target platform's secret store in the customer's
account, and are never stored or accessed by the Nuon control plane.

### App Configuration

While you can use [Inputs](/concepts/app-inputs) for your App's own internal
configuration and preferences -- such as setting an admin password or connecting
to a customer database -- we recommend against this if possible. Allowing your
customer to update settings like this within your app will likely provide a
better experience.

## Sandbox

The [Sandbox](/concepts/sandboxes) is where you define the environment your App
will run in, and therefore acts as part of the contract you are making with your
customer regarding access and security. This is where you will make foundational
decisions about the network resources will be deployed to, so it pays to be
thoughtful about what your App's requirements are.

We provide off-the-shelf sandboxes to get you started quickly. See the
[Sandboxes](/concepts/sandboxes#nuon-managed-sandboxes) page to learn how to use
these. A Sandbox is just a Terraform module, though, so you can also create a
custom Sandbox to meet more specialized needs.

Regardless of which Sandbox you use, we recommend pinning to a specific version,
and upgrading carefully to avoid disrupting your customer's experience of your
App.

### Isolated vs Customer-Managed Networks

The most important consideration for the Sandbox is whether your app will run in
it's own, isolated network, or be deployed into a customer-provided network. If
the latter, you will need to provide inputs to configure what network to deploy
in, and other options that will depend on the cloud platform you are deploying
to.

### Network Configuration

If you have the option of defining the network your App will be deployed in,
there are some best practices we recommend. Even if the customer is managing the
network, you may want to discuss these with them to ensure you are being set up
for success.

Be thoughtful about what subnets you define and how you use them. In most cases,
we recommend having 3 types:

- Private Subnets: This is where you should put most of your resources by
  default.
- Public Subnets: These should only be used for internet-facing resources, like
  public load balancers.
- Database Subnets: If your app includes any database, isolating them in their
  own subnet is a common best practice.

<Warning>
	Before making a load balancer internet-facing, consider whether it needs to
	be. Your customer may prefer keeping the App private to the network it's
	deployed in, and can access it using a VPN.
</Warning>

If your App does require internet-facing components, consider putting a WAF in
place to provide an extra layer of monitoring and protection.

## Components

[Components](/concepts/components) are how you model your app's architecture in
Nuon. How you configure these will define how your app is deployed and updated.

### Dependencies

Components typically have dependencies on each other. In the
[app](/concepts/apps) you can use Outputs from one Component as Inputs to
another to integrate them. Ensure you define Components in the correct order, so
a Component's dependencies are in place before it is deployed.

<Warning>
	Even if Components are deployed in the correct order, dependencies may still
	fail. Certain cloud resources may not be ready for use, even if they have been
	created successfully. When testing your App, look for potential race
	conditions that may require retries or other mitigations.
</Warning>

### Networking and DNS

You will typically need to manage DNS with your components to host your App at a
private or public URL. Customers often want to see apps hosted at a subdomain
under a domain they own, which will require integrating with a DNS zone that
they manage.

### Databases and Other Stateful Components

Stateful components can be challenging to manage with infra-as-code. This is
especially true of databases, as they tend to be costly, operationally complex,
and involve the risk of data loss.

Beyond just defining a [Component](/concepts/components) for resources like
these, you may want to use [Actions](/concepts/actions) to implement things like
schema migrations and configuration updates.
