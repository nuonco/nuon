Being able to quickly debug issues will be critical to providing a SaaS-like experience to your customers.
It pays to think ahead about what kind of issues your app might have, and how to inspect the state of your app and it's components.

## Actions

You can use actions to run commands inside an install to inspect it's state.

### Reading Logs

Customers typically will not want application logs leaving their environment, so we recommend reading them when needed via actions.
You should define actions up front for reading logs from the components of your app that provide them.
This will be especially useful for debugging issues with services like kubernetes pods, but can also be used to inspect platform-specific things like Cloudwatch logs.

### Healthchecks

In addition to running healthchecks on a cron, we recommend also having a manual trigger.
You may want to run certain healthchecks while debugging to check on the status of components.

## Runbooks

You should have a runbook for how to debug your app.
It can outline common issues, and link to any actions you have defined.
