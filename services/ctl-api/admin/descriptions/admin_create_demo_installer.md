Create a demo installer in sandbox mode. This is useful for creating customer install demos and other types of POCs to show off the power of Nuon.

To create an installer, you need the following:

* Company Name
* Installer slug (ie: the `nuon-demo` in https://app.nuon.co/installer/nuon-demo
* Docs link
* Demo url link (must have `embed` in it - https://total.wpexplorer.com/docs/get-embed-urllink-youtube-video/)
* Logo URL
* Github URL
* Homepage URL
* Description

Behind the scenes, this will automatically kickstart a configuration file, and create a sample app that can be shared. You can use the other endpoints in this namespace to find urls, and existing installers.
