Forget all installs that have a specific AWS account ID. Mainly, this is for us internally and useful for deleting installs in our canary and demo accounts:

* demo - 949309607565
* canary - 543425801867

Ideally, this isn't needed too often but many changes can result in an install being leaked and needing to be manually cleaned up.
