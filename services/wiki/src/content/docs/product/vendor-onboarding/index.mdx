This document outlines the standard operating procedure for onboarding a new vendor. The goal is to provide a consistent experience to vendors, with enough flexiblity to handle each vendor's unique constraints and requirements.

## Vendor Onboarding Process

The owner of this process is the Forward Deployed Engineer assigned to the given vendor. They are responsible for coordinating with both vendor and Nuon stakeholders. In cases where the vendor is focused on unlocking a high-value customer, there may also be customer stakeholders involved, but we should be careful to scope such involvement very carefully.

The primary communication channel with the vendor is their channel in nuon-byoc.slack.com.

The process goes as follows:

<Steps>
1. [Kick-Off](./kick-off)

    Meet with the vendor, collect their requirements, and align on timeline.

1. [Vertical Slice](./vertical-slice)

    Implement one app for them from end-to-end, and use that to suss out any issues.

1. [Multiple Apps](./multiple-apps)

    Once one app is working, implement all of the app configs they need.

1. [Production Installs](./production-installs)

    Help them get their first isntall for each app into production.

</Steps>

## Vendor Support

As part of onboarding the vendor, we will also begin providing support following our [Vendor Support Runbook](./vendor_support_runbook.md).
