## Description

The process begins with a kick-off meeting, where the FDE will align on timelines and deliverables with all the stakeholders involved.

## Important Questions

- Who are the stakeholders on the vendor's side?
- What does "deployed" means for their app. Use this as a basis for a production-readiness checklist.
- What platforms do they need to support?
- How many app configs will they need?
- Which config will we start with to get a vertical slice?
- Will we need to make any product updates to support them, such as changes to the inputs feature or the installers?

## Expected Outcomes

- A list of stakeholders, and github user names to share github repos with.
- A loose timeline. This could shift a bit during execution. That's fine as long as we communicate such changes early and often.
- Some branding assets we can use for the installer.
- Set up a Slack channel in nuon-byoc.slack.com for comms, if it's not set up already.
- A list of deliverables. Typically, this will consist of:
    - A matrix of the platforms and input options required. This will tell us how many app cofigs we need and how many version of the app we need to test.
    - An initial list of components (this will likely change during execution, but it's good to have a starting point.)
    - A custom installer built from our Next.js template.
    - A list of required product updates. We don't want to make a habit of changing our product willy-nilly, but if there are features that will unlock a vendor, and would make sense for other vendors to use, we can discuss adding them.
