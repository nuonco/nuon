## Description

Once you have a vertical slice working, add the rest of the app configs. As you complete each one, merge your changes to the shared repo and update the vendor.

It's a good idea to keep the vendor updated and solicit feedback throughout the process. Don't just wait until the entire vertical slice is ready. We want to foster an ongoing conversation with them.

## Testing

Use the matrix from the kick-off to ensure we test, not only each app config, but the different options each app has. We may need to test with certain components or features toggled off and on, or with different config values for some components.
