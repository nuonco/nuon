# go-workflows-meta

This package contains common tooling for pushing metadata from workflows into s3. Right now, it supports writing both a `request.json` and `response.json` into the correct bucket. This code should still be called from activities in the parent workflow, but implements the activity request and response types.

## Usage

Coming soon.
