This repo contains the complete source code of the Nuon control plane, runner, and CLI. Read our open-source announcement [here](https://nuon.co/blog/oss-announcement/).

## Getting started

The fastest way to get started with Nuon is to sign up for a free trial on Nuon Cloud at https://app.nuon.co. There are no limits to apps and installs, and all core Nuon features will be available to you for free.

Of course, being a BYOC platform, we can also deploy Nuon itself as a BYOC app into your AWS account. In addition to being an isolated, single-tenant install, you will also have access to additional features and configuration options not available on Cloud. If you're interested in this approach, please [contact us](https://nuon.co/contact-sales).

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, while Nuon can deploy apps to multiple cloud platforms, Nuon itself can only be deployed to AWS.
